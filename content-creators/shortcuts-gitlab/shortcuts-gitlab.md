Unlock your workflow and save hours each week by mastering the essential shortcuts in GitLab. Whether you’re a developer deep in code review or a project lead managing pipelines, the right key combinations make all the difference.

Why Keyboard Shortcuts Matter in GitLab
---------------------------------------

If navigating between projects, issues, merge requests, and pipelines feels like a repetitive mouse-marathon, you’re not alone. Moving your hand from keyboard to mouse, opening menus, clicking around — it adds up.

Here’s what mastering shortcuts can do for you:

*   Speed up navigation: Jump between projects, issues, and pipelines in seconds.
*   Stay focused on code: Keep your hands on the keyboard — fewer context switches.
*   Reduce manual clicks: Spend less time searching menus, more time building.
*   Impress your team: Lead efficient workflows and encourage keyboard-first habits.

Top Global Shortcuts You Should Know
------------------------------------

These shortcuts work across most areas of GitLab — your first step to power navigation.

### Navigation across GitLab

*   **?** Show/hide the shortcut reference sheet.
*   **Shift + P** Go to Projects page.
*   **Shift + G** Go to Groups page.
*   **Shift + A** Go to Activity feed.

### Search & Quick Access

*   **S or /** Put cursor in search bar.
*   **Shift + I** Go to Issues.
*   **Shift + M** Go to Merge Requests.

Project-Specific Shortcuts (Issues, MRs, Files & More)
------------------------------------------------------

Once you’re inside a project, these shortcuts help you drill down quickly.

### Issues & Merge Requests

*   **E** → Edit description.
*   **A** → Change assignee.
*   **M** → Change milestone.
*   **[ / ]** → Navigate between files in a merge request.

### Repository & Files

*   **G + F** → Go to project's files list.
*   **T** → Open “Find Files” dialog.
*   **Y** → Go to file permalink.

### CI/CD Jobs & Graphs

*   **G + J** → Go to Jobs page.
*   **G + N** → Go to repository graph.

Advanced Workflow & Productivity Hacks
--------------------------------------

Now that you know the basics, here’s how to layer in strategies that amplify your productivity:

### Developer/Reviewer Workflow

1.   Press ? to bring up the shortcut sheet and bookmark it (don’t skip this!).
2.   Use G + M to jump directly to Merge Requests.
3.   Inside a MR, use ] to move to next file, n to move to next discussion thread — keep your review flowing.
4.   Switch projects quickly with Shift + P, and then G + F to open the code you need — no mouse needed.

### Project-Manager Workflow

1.   From anywhere, use Shift + A to go to Activity feed.
2.   Use S or / to search across issues, comments, or project names.
3.   Use keyboard shortcuts when adding labels, assignees or milestone changes in issues — e.g., A to change assignee.
4.   Train your team: Share this cheat sheet and run a 10-minute session to adopt keyboard navigation by default.

Getting Started: How to Enable, Customize & Bookmark Shortcuts
--------------------------------------------------------------

*   Press ? to open GitLab’s built-in shortcut reference modal.
*   If shortcuts aren’t working, go to: Avatar → Preferences → Behaviour and ensure Enable keyboard shortcuts is checked.
*   On Mac vs Windows/Linux: Some keyboard modifiers differ (e.g., ⌘ vs Ctrl). Make sure you test your OS.
*   Bookmark this page and pin the cheat sheet to your workspace so shortcuts become second nature.
