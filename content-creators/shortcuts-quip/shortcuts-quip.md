Why Keyboard Shortcuts Matter in Quip
-------------------------------------

Quip was built for real-time collaboration — docs, spreadsheets, and conversations, all in one place. But with so many features, the menus can get crowded fast.

Keyboard shortcuts keep your hands on the keyboard and your focus on the work. They help you:

*   **Save time:** Skip repetitive clicks and switch between tasks instantly.
*   **Navigate easily:** Jump across documents, folders, and chats without breaking flow.
*   **Collaborate efficiently:** Add comments, tag teammates, or edit content in seconds.
*   **Stay in focus mode:** No need to reach for the mouse or hunt through toolbars.

Whether you’re a project manager, sales exec, developer, or content creator, these shortcuts will make your Quip experience smoother and faster.

How to Use Shortcuts Effectively
--------------------------------

Don’t try to learn them all at once. The key to mastering shortcuts is gradual adoption.

*   Start small — Pick 2–3 shortcuts that match your daily routine (like Bold, Comment, or Search).
*   Keep the PDF handy — Print it, pin it, or keep it open in another tab.
*   Level up weekly — Add a few new shortcuts each week and review older ones until they’re second nature.

Soon, you’ll be navigating, editing, and collaborating in Quip faster than you ever thought possible.

Windows vs Mac Shortcuts — What’s Different?
--------------------------------------------

Most shortcuts are identical except for the modifier key:

*   **Windows:** Use Ctrl and Alt
*   **Mac:** Use ⌘ (Command) and Option

Example:

*   Insert link: Ctrl + K (Windows) or ⌘ + K (Mac)
*   Create new document: Ctrl + Alt + N (Windows) or ⌘ + Option + N (Mac)

If you work across both platforms, our PDF highlights the exact differences for every command.

Collaboration & Team Productivity Tips
--------------------------------------

Shortcuts aren’t just for solo users — they’re for teams. Use them to make meetings shorter, document reviews faster, and communication smoother.

Try this workflow:

*   Open your doc → press Ctrl + Shift + C (or ⌘ + Shift + C) to open comments.
*   Add feedback or tag a teammate with @name.
*   Resolve it instantly with Ctrl + Enter (or ⌘ + Enter).

No mouse clicks, no context switching — just pure collaboration speed.
