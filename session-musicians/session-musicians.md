Otto AI is modernising Finance

Your Finances, Under Control.
-----------------------------

Smart, simple finances for session musicians — focus on playing clean takes, not cleaning up financial chaos.

In Good Company

"Otto gets what creative businesses need—simplicity, speed, and no distractions."

Entity Management

Form Your Music Business and Keep It Moving
-------------------------------------------

Otto AI helps session musicians register an LLC or S-Corp to separate your personal life from your freelance gigs. Look professional, protect your income, and maybe even get fewer “can you do it for free?” texts.

Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping for Gigs, Gear, and Gas
-----------------------------------

Otto AI logs all your music-related expenses—travel, strings, reeds, sticks, software, tuners, sheet music, and the pedal you definitely didn’t need (but yes you did). It's all tracked, categorized, and deductible.

Invoicing

Invoicing That Hits as Hard as You Do
-------------------------------------

Whether you charge hourly, per track, per gig, or project-based, Otto AI lets you send clear, professional invoices with your rate, session date, and payment terms. No more “just send me your info again” headaches.

Contracts

Contracts That Don’t Leave You Hanging
--------------------------------------

Use Otto AI’s contract templates designed for session work. Set terms for rates, usage, credits, revisions, publishing splits, and kill fees. Keep it tight. Keep it legal.

Tax Tools Built for Freelance Hustle
------------------------------------

Otto AI keeps up with your odd jobs, session fees, music licensing payments, and teaching side gigs. It tracks deductions and income in real time, so you’re ready for tax season before April sneaks up on you.

Reports

Know Which Gigs Are Worth Repeating
-----------------------------------

Otto AI shows you which clients pay on time, which sessions are profitable, and which “great exposure” gigs cost you more than they made. Plan your year with data, not gut feelings.
