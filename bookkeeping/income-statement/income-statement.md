----------------------------

An **income statement**, also known as a profit and loss statement, is an important financial document that shows how much money a business earned and spent over a specific period, like a month or a year. It helps business owners and investors understand if a company is making a profit or facing a loss. Think of it as a report card for a business's financial performance.

### What Information Does an Income Statement Include?

The income statement typically includes the following key sections:

*   **Revenue:** This is the total money earned from sales or services provided. For example, if a bakery sells cakes, all the money from those sales is included here.
*   **Expenses:** These are the costs incurred to run the business, like rent, salaries, and ingredients for baking. It’s important to list all expenses to see how much money is used up.
*   **Net Income:** This is the final number on the income statement. It shows the profit or loss after subtracting total expenses from total revenue. A positive net income means profit, while a negative net income indicates a loss.

### Why is the Income Statement Important?

The income statement is crucial because it helps various stakeholders, including business owners, investors, and creditors, make informed decisions. Here are some reasons why:

*   **Performance Tracking:** It allows businesses to track financial performance over time and identify trends.
*   **Budgeting:** Business owners can use it to plan future expenses and set budgets.
*   **Investment Decisions:** Investors often look at income statements to determine if a company is a good investment.

Overall, the income statement is a key tool for understanding the financial health of a business.
