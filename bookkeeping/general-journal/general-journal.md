What is a General Journal?
--------------------------

A **general journal** is a fundamental part of accounting where all financial transactions are recorded. Think of it as your first notebook where you jot down everything that happens with money in your business. It keeps track of all types of transactions before they are organized into different accounts. This helps ensure that every financial event is documented properly.

### How Does a General Journal Work?

In the general journal, each entry includes important details about the transaction:

*   **Date**: The day the transaction took place.
*   **Description**: A short explanation of what the transaction is about (like “Sale of Product A”).
*   **Debit**: The amount of money that is added to an account.
*   **Credit**: The amount of money that is taken away from an account.

For example, if your business sells a product for $100, you would record that as a debit in the sales account and a credit in the cash account. This way, you can always see where money is coming from and where it is going.

### Why is a General Journal Important?

The general journal is vital for a few reasons:

*   It provides a complete record of all transactions.
*   It helps to prevent mistakes by showing the details of each transaction.
*   It lays the groundwork for preparing important financial statements later on.

By keeping an accurate general journal, you ensure that your financial records are organized and reliable, making it easier to understand your business's financial health.
