Defining Trial Balance: Purpose and Practical Examples
======================================================

What is a Trial Balance?
------------------------

A trial balance is a financial report that summarizes the balances of all [ledger](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/general-ledger) accounts at a specific point in time. It serves as an initial check of the mathematical accuracy of a company’s bookkeeping before the final financial statements are prepared. By ensuring that total debits equal total credits, the trial balance helps identify errors in the accounting records.

Purpose of a Trial Balance For Creators
---------------------------------------

For creators managing their finances, a trial balance is a useful tool for ensuring your accounts are balanced and accurate. It provides a foundation for preparing key financial statements, like the income statement and [balance sheet](https://joinotto.com/templates/balance-sheet), making it easier to understand your overall financial health.

Types of Trial Balance
----------------------

‍

**1. Unadjusted Trial Balance**The _unadjusted trial balance_ is prepared at the end of an accounting period, listing all account balances before any adjustments are made. This version reflects the actual balances recorded in the [general ledger](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/general-ledger).

**Trial Balance Example:**

![Image 4: Trial Balance Example](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66fc5ede442e88dc7e56a366/6773c32ec057a1c44889b22a_6752a0451a9ab4d68a5a29c3_67529ede08e043abd4b8c872_Screenshot_5.png)

**2. Adjusted Trial Balance**After making necessary adjustments, the _adjusted trial balance_ is created to reflect these changes accurately. It includes any accrued or deferred items and corrects errors identified during the period.

**Adjusted Trial Balance Example:**

![Image 5: Adjusted Trial Balance Example](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66fc5ede442e88dc7e56a366/6773c32ec057a1c44889b227_6752a0451a9ab4d68a5a29af_67529f0d2ac07961da21f17e_Screenshot_6.png)

Post-Closing Trial Balance
--------------------------

The _post-closing trial balance_ is prepared after closing entries have been made to verify that the accounts are still in balance after the closing process. This balance reflects only the permanent accounts since temporary accounts are reset to zero.

Trial Balance vs. Balance Sheet
-------------------------------

The _trial balance_ and _balance sheet_ serve different purposes in accounting. While the trial balance is an internal report used to ensure that debits equal credits, the balance sheet is a formal financial statement that shows a company's financial position at a specific date, including its assets, liabilities, and equity.

Trial Balance Format
--------------------

A typical _trial balance format_ consists of a two-column layout, with one column for debits and another for credits. Each account from the general ledger is listed, along with its respective balance. The totals of both columns must be equal to confirm the correctness of the records.

Importance of Trial Balance for Creators
----------------------------------------

For creators managing their own businesses, a trial balance is a critical tool. It helps ensure your financial records are accurate, making it easier to [prepare taxes](https://joinotto.com/tax-return), secure funding, or simply get a clear picture of your financial health. Regular checks can also make it easier to spot and fix mistakes early on.

Common Errors in Preparing a Trial Balance
------------------------------------------

When preparing a _trial balance_, several common errors can occur, including:

*   **Transposition Errors:** Mixing up numbers (e.g., writing $540 instead of $450).
*   **Omitted Accounts:** Failing to include all relevant accounts.
*   **Incorrect Balances:** Entering incorrect amounts for account balances.
*   **Double Counting:** Listing an account balance in both the debit and credit columns.

Identifying these errors early in the accounting process can save time and effort during year-end closing.

Steps to Prepare a Trial Balance
--------------------------------

1.   **List All Accounts:** Gather all the accounts from the [general ledger](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/general-ledger).
2.   **Determine Balances:** Calculate the ending balances for each account.
3.   **Prepare Columns:** Create two columns—one for debits and one for credits.
4.   **Input Balances:** Enter each account's balance in the appropriate column.
5.   **Total Columns:** Calculate the total for both the debit and credit columns.
6.   ‍**Check for Equality:** Ensure that total debits equal total credits. If they do not match, investigate discrepancies.

FAQs
----

### What is a trial balance, and why is it important for creators?



A trial balance is a report showing the balances of all your accounts. It helps verify the accuracy of your records and ensures everything adds up correctly before creating final reports.

### What’s the difference between an unadjusted and an adjusted trial balance?

### Can a trial balance reveal errors in my accounts?



Yes, a trial balance can catch errors like transposition mistakes or missing entries, but it won’t detect all errors, such as transactions being recorded in the wrong accounts. Regular reviews are still important for comprehensive error detection.

### What happens if my trial balance doesn’t balance?

If your trial balance doesn’t balance, it indicates discrepancies in your accounting records. This could be due to errors like omitted entries, incorrect amounts, or unbalanced debits and credits. Investigating and correcting these issues ensures your financial statements are reliable and accurate.
