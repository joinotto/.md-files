### What is a Month End Close Checklist?

A month-end close checklist is a list of tasks that need to be completed at the end of each month to close out your business's financials. This process involves reviewing all transactions, balancing your accounts, and ensuring everything is up to date for accurate financial reporting.

### Why Should Creators Use a Month End Close Checklist?

As a creator or Influencer, you’re managing multiple projects and revenue streams. From client payments to monthly expenses and taxes, keeping track of your finances can get overwhelming. A month-end close checklist helps you stay organized and ensures you don’t miss important steps in managing your finances.
