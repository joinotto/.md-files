Reimbursable expenses are costs that creators, Influencers, or contractors incur while working on projects that are eligible to be reimbursed by their clients or employers.

Essentially, reimbursable expenses are out-of-pocket costs that directly support your creative work.

*   Gas mileage or car rental costs if the project requires transportation to a specific location (e.g., photoshoots, video shoots).

#### **2. Supplies and Equipment**

*   Cameras, microphones, lighting equipment, or other tech tools essential for content creation.

### **How Reimbursable Expenses Work**

For reimbursable expenses to be processed smoothly, you’ll need to follow a few key steps:

#### **1. Clear Agreements**

*   Before you incur any expenses, it’s crucial to have a clear agreement with your client about what costs will be reimbursed. This should be outlined in your contract or service agreement. Be sure to confirm in advance which expenses are covered and which are not.

#### **2. Document Everything**

*   Keep receipts, invoices, or bank statements that provide proof of your expenses. This documentation is essential for the reimbursement process.
*   Platforms like Otto make it easier for creators to track and submit these expenses, reducing the chances of missing anything important.

#### **3. Reimbursement Process**

*   To get reimbursed, you typically submit an expense report that lists each expense, along with the receipts and a brief explanation of why each cost was necessary for the project.
*   Reimbursement timelines will vary depending on the agreement with your client, so always check the expected processing time.
