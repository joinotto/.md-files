Equipment & Gear
----------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Equipment Purchases (Section 179 or Depreciation)

You can deduct the full cost of gear like cameras and lighting using Section 179 or depreciation. Washington has no income tax, so there’s no state-level adjustment. Keep receipts and use IRS Form 4562 for federal reporting.

$

Small Equipment & Supplies

Items under $2,500 like tripods, batteries, and SD cards can be expensed immediately under the federal de minimis rule. WA has no income tax, so these federal deductions do not affect state returns—but do factor into property tax reports.

$

Sales Tax & Use Tax on Equipment

Washington photographers pay retail sales tax on most gear. If you buy out-of-state or online without sales tax, you must pay use tax to WA. You cannot use a reseller permit to avoid tax on equipment—it’s not for resale.

$

Business Personal Property Tax

All business gear is subject to local personal property tax in WA. File a listing with your county assessor by April 30 annually. Even fully depreciated or unused items are taxed. Deduct this property tax on your federal return.

$

Studio/Office Rent, Utilities & Insurance
-----------------------------------------

Deductions for studio/office rent, utilities, and insurance

Utilities & Office Services

Business-use portions of utilities—electricity, internet, phone, water—are deductible when tied to your studio or home office. Keep itemized bills and document business-use percentages if shared with personal use.

$

Business Insurance Premiums

Premiums for general liability, gear insurance, and property coverage are deductible federally. In Washington, insurance is not subject to sales tax. These costs reduce federal income only; WA has no state income tax deductions.

$

Leasehold & Local Fees

Commercial rent in WA is not subject to retail sales tax, but if leasing from a government body, leasehold excise tax may apply. This is often built into the rent. WA does not allow any B&O deduction for rent or utilities.

$

Travel & Transportation
-----------------------

Deductions for travel and transportation expenses

Vehicle Mileage or Actual Expenses

Business driving is deductible using the IRS mileage rate (67¢ per mile for 2024) or actual vehicle expenses. Track business miles or use a percentage-based method for gas, maintenance, insurance, and depreciation. Choose one method per vehicle per year.

$

Airfare, Lodging & Trip Costs

Out-of-town business trips qualify for deductions—flights, hotels, taxis, parking, and 50% of meals. Keep detailed receipts and document the business purpose of each trip. Only costs for the business portion of a mixed trip are deductible.

$

Client-Related Travel Charges

If you bill clients for travel—like mileage or lodging—Washington includes those charges in your taxable gross income. These client reimbursements are subject to B&O and sales tax if the underlying service is taxable.

$

No State-Level Travel Deduction (WA)

Washington B&O tax does not allow expense deductions for travel costs like gas or airfare. All travel costs are federal deductions only. If a trip involves delivering goods out of state, you may claim a B&O deduction for “interstate sales.”

$

Subcontractors & Assistants
---------------------------

Deductions for subcontractors and assistants

Contract Labor & Freelancers (1099-NEC Eligible)

Payments to second shooters, editors, or lighting assistants are deductible federally as contract labor. Issue Form 1099-NEC if you pay $600+ to any unincorporated contractor. Keep W-9s, invoices, and payment records.

$

No Deduction from B&O Tax (WA)

Washington B&O tax is based on gross income—labor costs like subcontractor pay do not reduce your state tax. You owe B&O tax on the full client payment, even if a portion goes to a second shooter or assistant.

$

Tax Classification & Labor Treatment

Hiring a freelancer does not change your B&O classification. If your work is taxable as a retail sale (e.g., client receives tangible prints or digital files), the full amount—including labor charges—is subject to retail B&O and sales tax.

$

No Resale Exemption for Services

You cannot use a reseller permit to exempt subcontractor services from sales tax. Only tangible goods for resale qualify. Labor is never treated as a resale input in Washington tax law.

$

Training, Education & Professional Development
----------------------------------------------

Deductions for training, education, and professional development expenses

Workshops, Classes & Professional Training

Fees for workshops, seminars, conferences, and online courses that improve your skills are fully deductible federally. These must relate to your current photography work. Keep receipts, course details, and proof of payment for each event.

$

Sales Tax on Digital Training (WA Rule)

Washington treats live workshops and interactive online classes as non-taxable services. But pre-recorded tutorials, digital downloads, or automated video courses are taxable digital goods. If the vendor doesn’t charge sales tax, you're responsible for reporting use tax.

$

Professional Memberships & Dues

Dues to photography organizations like PPA or local associations are federally deductible and generally not subject to sales tax in Washington. These fees are seen as payment for intangible services.

$

No B&O Tax Deduction for Training

Washington B&O tax does not allow deductions for educational costs or professional development. Even if you spend thousands on training, your gross receipts for B&O remain unchanged.

$

Marketing, Advertising & Website Costs
--------------------------------------

Deductions for marketing, advertising, and website expenses

Advertising & Promotion Expenses

Expenses for online ads, flyers, bridal shows, and marketing campaigns are fully deductible federally. This includes social media promotions, business cards, and branding materials. Keep records for each expense category (print, digital, design, etc.).

$

Sales Tax on Printed Materials

Printed marketing materials (e.g. brochures, business cards) are considered tangible goods in Washington and are subject to retail sales tax. If purchased out of state without tax, you must pay use tax on the full cost.

$

Digital Marketing Tools & Services

Fees for hosting, domain names, and custom design are usually not taxed, but subscriptions to gallery platforms, CRMs, or cloud software may be taxed as digital automated services. Keep vendor receipts and confirm whether sales tax was applied.

$

Business Insurance, Licensing & Permits
---------------------------------------

Deductions for business insurance, licensing, and permits

Insurance Premiums (Liability, Equipment, E&O)

Business insurance—including liability, equipment, and errors & omissions—is fully deductible federally. Washington does not impose sales tax on insurance premiums, but they do not reduce B&O tax, as no expense deductions are allowed.

$

Washington Business License & Endorsements

Most photographers must obtain a WA Business License (UBI) if earning over $12,000/year or collecting sales tax. The initial state license fee is $19, with $10 renewals per city endorsement annually. These fees are not deductible against B&O.

$

Permits for Locations or Shoots

Fees paid for city park permits, state land access, or special event licenses are deductible federally. In WA, these are typically non-taxable fees and don’t incur sales tax. Keep all permit receipts on file.

$

Reseller Permit (Print Materials Only)

Washington allows photographers to use a reseller permit to buy items like photo paper, albums, and frames tax-free if they’re resold to clients. You must be registered and keep records proving resale use.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies
--------------------------------------

Deductions for props, backdrops, and consumable supplies

Props & Set Materials

Items like backdrops, costumes, and set décor are fully deductible business expenses federally. In Washington, these are taxable at purchase—you pay sales tax since they are considered used by the photographer, not resold.

$

Consumable Supplies (Batteries, Ink, Cards)

Expendables like batteries, memory cards, printer ink, cleaning kits, and packaging materials are deductible when used in your business. Washington considers you the consumer of these items, so sales or use tax applies.

$

No Resale Exemption on General Supplies

You may not use a reseller permit to avoid tax on general supplies, tools, or props that are used in your workflow (not resold). Misuse may lead to tax, interest, and 50% penalties if audited.

$

Print Inputs for Resale (Paper, Frames)

If an item becomes part of the client deliverable (e.g. albums, photo paper, mounting boards), you can use a reseller permit to buy it tax-free. You then collect sales tax from the client on the final product.

$

Use Tax Compliance for Online Purchases

If you buy props or supplies from out-of-state vendors who do not charge WA sales tax, you must self-assess and pay use tax. The rate equals your local sales tax and applies to all business-use items.

$

Bank Fees, Loan Interest & Financial Expenses
---------------------------------------------

Deductions for bank fees, loan interest, and financial expenses

Bank & Credit Card Processing Fees

Charges from your bank (monthly fees, wire transfers) and credit card processors (Stripe, Square, PayPal) are fully deductible federally. In Washington, no sales tax applies to these services, but they do not reduce B&O tax liability.

$

Loan Interest on Business Financing

Interest on business loans, credit lines, or equipment financing is deductible federally. However, Washington offers no deduction for interest costs against the B&O tax. These expenses only affect your net profit for federal tax.

$

Late Fees & Financial Penalties

IRS penalties or WA B&O filing fines are not deductible. Other charges—like late fees on business bills—may be deductible federally but don’t affect WA tax. Always keep documentation to verify interest charges were business-related.

$

No WA Tax Deduction Allowed

Unlike federal tax, Washington gross receipts-based B&O tax does not allow deductions for operating costs. That means bank fees, loan interest, and processing charges don’t reduce your state tax owed—they’re just overhead.

$

Sales Tax Status (Not Taxed)

Washington does not charge sales tax on financial services. You will never pay WA sales tax on bank fees, credit card processing, or loan interest. This saves upfront cost, but offers no back-end deduction under B&O rules.
