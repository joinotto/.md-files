Equipment & Gear Essentials
---------------------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Equipment Purchases

Cameras, lenses, lighting gear, editing computers, and long-term equipment can be fully expensed in the first year using Section 179 or depreciated over time. Georgia conforms to federal Section 179 limits (over $1 million) but does not allow federal bonus depreciation—adjust depreciation using GA Form 4562.

$

Small Tools, Software & Accessories

Items with a shorter useful life (e.g. batteries, SD cards, memory readers, cleaning kits) and monthly software like Adobe subscriptions are fully deductible in the year incurred. Georgia adopts federal treatment—these costs are expensed normally without state modification.

$

Depreciation Records & Usage Allocation

Use IRS Form 4562 to claim depreciation and Section 179 deductions. Keep documentation showing purchase date, business use %, and when equipment was placed in service. Georgia respects federal business-use percentages and does not require depreciation addbacks (except for bonus depreciation).

$

Business Personal Property Tax

While Georgia has no state-level business property tax, most counties levy a tangible personal property tax on business equipment (e.g. cameras, lighting gear). You must report assets annually if you exceed the local exemption threshold—check your county tax assessor's site for details.

$

Studio/Office Expenses
----------------------

Deductions for studio and office expenses

Studio Rent & Utilities

Rent for dedicated studio or office space is fully deductible, along with utilities like electricity, internet, water, and property insurance. Georgia follows federal treatment—these expenses reduce both federal and state taxable income without adjustment.

$

Home Office Deduction (Simplified or Standard Method)

If you work from home, you can claim the home office deduction using the simplified method ($5 per sq. ft up to 300 sq. ft) or the standard method via IRS Form 8829. Georgia honors whichever method is used on your federal return—no extra forms or limits apply.

$

Insurance Premiums (Studio or Home Workspace)

Business property insurance for a studio or home office, plus any security system costs, are fully deductible. Georgia treats business insurance expenses the same as federal rules—100% deductible from taxable income.

$

Business Property Tax (Local Level)

If your studio is subject to local property tax or tangible asset tax (common in Georgia counties), those taxes are deductible as business expenses on your federal and Georgia returns.

$

Business Travel, Vehicles & Transportation
------------------------------------------

Deductions for travel and transportation expenses

Business Vehicle Use (Mileage or Actual Expense Method)

Driving to shoots, meetings, or client locations is deductible using the standard mileage rate (e.g., $0.655–$0.67 per mile) or actual auto expenses (gas, maintenance, insurance, depreciation). Georgia conforms to federal rules—deductions taken on Schedule C carry over to the state return.

$

Mileage Logs & Business Use Percentage

Keep a mileage log or use a tracking app to record business trips. Personal commuting (e.g. home to studio) is not deductible. Georgia does not require a separate log—just maintain proper records for audit purposes.

$

Out-of-Town Travel (Lodging, Flights, Meals)

Travel for client shoots, workshops, or conferences is deductible. This includes airfare, hotel, rideshare, and 50% of meal costs. Georgia follows the federal 50% meal deduction rule—no state-specific limits.

$

Vehicle Purchase & Depreciation Limits

You may deduct depreciation for business-use vehicles or elect Section 179. Georgia does not allow federal bonus depreciation for vehicles, so luxury auto write-offs must follow normal depreciation rules via GA Form 4562.

$

Subcontractors, Assistants & Freelancers
----------------------------------------

Deductions for contracted labor

Freelancers, Second Shooters & Assistants (1099-NEC Required)

Payments to independent contractors—like second shooters, editors, makeup artists, or set assistants—are fully deductible as “Contract Labor.” Issue a 1099-NEC to any unincorporated individual paid $600 or more during the year. Georgia recognizes these federal deductions without adjustment.

$

Employee Wages & Payroll Taxes

If you have employees, wages paid and the employer share of payroll taxes (FICA, FUTA, Georgia unemployment tax) are deductible. Georgia follows federal treatment—these costs reduce your taxable income.

$

Work Authorization & Documentation (GA-Specific Rule)

Georgia law disallows deductions for labor payments over $600 to workers not authorized to work in the U.S. Keep a completed Form I-9 or copy of a Georgia ID on file to preserve the deduction. E-Verify is required if you employ a certain number of workers.

$

Proof of Payment & Invoices

Maintain contractor W-9s, invoices, and payment records (bank statements or processor reports). Georgia requires no special documentation beyond what’s needed federally—but records should be audit-ready.

$

Training, Education & Development
---------------------------------

Deductions for training & professional development

Workshops, Courses & Skill-Based Education

Expenses for professional development directly related to your photography business—like lighting workshops, editing classes, or online photography courses—are fully deductible. Georgia follows federal guidelines and allows these deductions without limitation.

$

Books, Subscriptions & Industry Materials

Deductions include books, magazines, trade journals, and subscriptions (e.g., PPA membership, educational platforms) that support your current skills. These are ordinary and necessary expenses fully deductible on both federal and Georgia returns.

$

Conferences & Travel for Training

If training requires travel (e.g., a seminar in another state), lodging, transportation, and 50% of meals are deductible. Georgia conforms to federal travel and education expense rules—no separate treatment required.

$

Education Must Relate to Current Trade

Only training that improves or maintains skills in your existing business qualifies. Georgia defers to IRS rules—education that prepares you for a new trade is not deductible.

$

Marketing, Branding & Online Presence
-------------------------------------

Deductions for marketing & advertising

Digital & Print Advertising

Expenses for business cards, brochures, flyers, branded materials, and online ads (Google, Meta, etc.) are fully deductible. Georgia adopts federal treatment—these costs reduce both federal and state taxable income without adjustment.

$

Website & Branding Costs

Website hosting, domain registration, design templates, SEO services, and costs to create or maintain your business website are deductible as advertising expenses. Georgia does not require any separate classification for these deductions.

$

Trade Shows, Promotions & Paid Social Media

Fees for bridal expos, vendor booths, banners, influencer marketing, or boosted social posts qualify as marketing expenses. Georgia allows 100% deduction in line with federal rules.

$

Marketing Materials & Creative Services

Design services for logos, newsletters, portfolio books, and framed samples are deductible. Georgia also allows deductions for promotional materials—even if sales tax was charged on printing or merchandise, the full amount is deductible.

$

Business Insurance, Licensing & Permits
---------------------------------------

Deductions for insurance & licenses

Business Insurance Premiums

Insurance for general liability, equipment coverage, professional liability (E&O), and commercial auto are fully deductible. Georgia allows these deductions without restriction—they reduce your state taxable income just like they do federally.

$

Workers’ Comp, Bonding & Specialty Coverage

Premiums for workers’ compensation (if applicable) and bonding insurance (required for certain contracts) are also deductible. Georgia follows IRS standards—no state-specific rules apply.

$

Business License & Permit Fees

Annual fees for local business licenses, occupational taxes, or shoot permits (e.g. public park or event permits) are deductible. Georgia permits full deduction of these fees on your state return—no limitations or addbacks required.

$

Entity Formation Costs & Compliance Fees

Startup and maintenance costs—like Georgia LLC formation ($100), annual registration fees ($50), and legal/accounting help—are deductible or amortized. Georgia treats these expenses as deductible if recognized federally.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies
--------------------------------------

Deductions for supplies & consumables

Props & Set Materials

Expenses for props, furniture, backdrops, seasonal, and client costumes are fully deductible in the year purchased if they are low-cost or used up within a year. Georgia follows federal rules—no special treatment is required.

$

Consumables & Small Tools

Memory cards, camera batteries, lighting bulbs, lens cloths, tape, printer ink, and other short-life items are expensed immediately. Georgia mirrors federal rules—these costs flow through without adjustment.

$

Software Subscriptions & Office Supplies

Monthly subscriptions (like Adobe Creative Cloud), pens, paper, mailing supplies, and stationery are deductible as supplies. Georgia allows the same deductions—no decoupling or state-specific limitations apply.

$

Sales Tax & Resale Exemptions

Photographers can avoid sales tax on materials resold to clients (e.g. albums, prints, frames) by using Georgia’s resale certificate (Form ST-5). Georgia allows these purchases tax-free and considers the resale items part of cost of goods sold.

$

Business Financial Fees, Interest & Banking Costs
-------------------------------------------------

Deductions for financial expenses

Bank Charges & Payment Processing Fees

Monthly fees from your business bank account, wire transfer charges, and credit card processor fees (e.g. PayPal, Stripe) are fully deductible. Georgia accepts these deductions as-is from your federal return—no changes required.

$

Interest on Business Loans & Credit Cards

Interest paid on loans used for photography equipment, studio expenses, or business credit cards is deductible. Georgia does not apply the federal business interest limitation (IRC §163(j)), meaning even disallowed federal interest is deductible at the state level.

$

Professional Services (Legal, Accounting, Tax Prep)

Fees paid to attorneys, CPAs, or consultants for business matters—like contract drafting, tax prep, or licensing help—are deductible. Georgia mirrors IRS treatment and allows the full deduction.

$

Loan Principal & Personal Finance Costs (Not Deductible)

Loan principal repayments are not deductible, and fees on personal bank or credit card accounts should not be claimed. Georgia follows federal classification—only business-related financial costs qualify.

$

Other State-Specific Deductions
-------------------------------

Other deductions specific to Georgia

Georgia Entertainment Industry Tax Credit

Photographers involved in large-scale film, TV, music video, or commercial productions may qualify for Georgia’s Entertainment Tax Credit—20% (plus 10% bonus if the GA logo is used) for projects with ≥$500K in qualified spend. Most freelancers won’t qualify individually, but production companies can benefit. The credit is transferable.

$

Post-Production & Interactive Credits (VFX/Game Work)

Georgia also offers tax credits for certified post-production and game development projects, which could apply if your work includes visual effects or editing. These programs require registration and significant qualifying expenses.

$

Sales Tax Obligations for Digital & Tangible Deliverables

As of 2024, Georgia requires photographers to collect sales tax on digital images and prints—digital files are now considered taxable tangible property. Register for a Sales & Use Tax ID via the Georgia Tax Center. Sales tax collected is not income and not deductible, but expenses incurred to comply (e.g. software, accountant fees) are deductible.

$

Use Tax on Untaxed Out-of-State Purchases

If you buy equipment or materials from out-of-state vendors that don’t charge Georgia sales tax, you must self-report use tax. This tax is added to the item’s cost basis and the full amount remains deductible on your income taxes.
