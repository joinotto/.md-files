Equipment & Gear Deductions
---------------------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Equipment Purchases (Section 179 or Depreciation)

Cameras, lenses, lighting, and computer gear can be expensed using Section 179 or depreciated over time. Delaware fully conforms to federal rules, including 100% bonus depreciation. Maintain Form 4562 and an asset log for audit.

$

Small Equipment, Software & Supplies

Items like memory cards, batteries, and software subscriptions are deductible. Most off-the-shelf software can be fully expensed. DE has no sales tax, so you deduct the full amount paid without separate tracking.

$

Repairs & Maintenance

Repair costs for gear (cleanings, parts, servicing) are deductible when incurred. No depreciation is needed. Delaware treats these as standard business expenses—just keep itemized receipts to show purpose and cost.

$

Sales Tax on Out-of-State Gear

Delaware has no sales tax, but if you pay sales tax out-of-state, include it in the item's cost basis. This amount is depreciated or expensed as part of the total purchase cost, not claimed separately.

$

Depreciation Records & Business Use

For Section 179 or bonus depreciation, ensure assets are used over 50% for business. Prorate mixed-use items. Delaware accepts federal depreciation schedules—retain receipts, service dates, and usage logs.

$

Studio/Office Rent, Utilities & Insurance in Delaware
-----------------------------------------------------

Deductions for studio and office expenses

Studio Rent & Utilities

Rent paid for a dedicated studio, co-working space, or storage unit is fully deductible. Utilities like electricity, water, internet, and phone services used for business are also deductible. Keep lease agreements and utility bills.

$

Home Office Deduction

If you use a portion of your home exclusively for your photography business, deduct via the simplified ($5/sq ft) or actual expense method. DE honors federal Form 8829. Maintain floor plans and all relevant household bills.

$

Studio Insurance Premiums

Insurance for rented studio space, including business property or liability coverage, is fully deductible. Delaware doesn’t tax insurance services—premiums are simply expensed as part of overhead.

$

Shared Utility or Service Costs

For internet or phone plans used partly for business, deduct only the business-use portion. Allocate based on documented usage. Keep bills showing dates and service scope to validate your claim.

$

Delaware Compliance & Licensing

Studios operating in Delaware must have a valid state business license ($75/year). This fee is deductible under “licenses and permits.” There’s no rental or occupancy tax—deduct actual amounts paid for rent and services.

$

Travel & Transportation in Delaware
-----------------------------------

Deductions for travel and transportation expenses

Vehicle Expenses (Mileage or Actual Costs)

Deduct business vehicle use via the IRS mileage rate (70¢ per mile for 2025) or actual expenses (gas, repairs, insurance). Maintain a detailed mileage log and receipts. Commuting isn’t deductible unless home is your principal business location.

$

Parking Fees & Tolls

Parking fees and tolls directly related to business trips are deductible separately from mileage or auto expenses. Always document dates, locations, and business purpose for each charge.

$

Business Travel (Lodging, Transport, Meals)

Travel for client shoots, conferences, or workshops is deductible. Include airfare, hotel, rental cars, taxis, and 50% of business meals. Save receipts, itineraries, and evidence of business purpose like client emails or event agendas.

$

Per Diem Option for Meals

Instead of tracking actual meal costs, you may use federal per diem rates for meals and incidental expenses. Only 50% of meals are deductible either way. Delaware follows this without adjustment.

$

Delaware Gross Receipts Caution

Auto and travel expenses reduce your income tax—but not your Gross Receipts Tax (GRT). GRT is based on gross income before deductions. Track both sets of numbers clearly.

$

Subcontractors & Assistants Deductions
--------------------------------------

Deductions for contracted labor

Independent Contractors (1099-NEC)

Payments to freelancers—second shooters, editors, consultants—are deductible as contract labor. Issue Form 1099-NEC if total payments exceed $600 annually. Collect W-9s and retain proof of payment for tax compliance.

$

Employee Wages & Payroll Taxes

Wages to studio assistants or other employees are deductible, along with employer-paid Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment taxes. Register with Delaware Division of Revenue if employing staff.

$

Licensing & Compliance

Contractors performing work in Delaware must have a Delaware business license. Your deduction isn’t affected by their licensing status, but confirming compliance is good practice for audit protection.

$

No State Withholding on Contractors

Delaware generally does not require state tax withholding for independent contractors. They pay their own income taxes. Still, document payments and verify contractor status properly.

$

Gross Receipts Tax Applies on Full Amount

Contract labor expenses reduce income tax but do not reduce Delaware Gross Receipts Tax. GRT is calculated on total revenue—deductions apply only to income tax, not to GRT.

$

Training & Professional Development in Delaware
-----------------------------------------------

Deductions for training & professional development

Workshops & Continuing Education

Photography workshops, seminars, and courses that enhance your existing skills are fully deductible. The education must relate to your current business—not a new career. Retain receipts and course descriptions for documentation.

$

Online Courses & Certifications

Online classes and professional certifications like drone licensing or Photoshop mastery are deductible if they build on existing business skills. Keep digital receipts and proof of completion.

$

Conferences & Industry Events

Conference registration fees (e.g., PPA or WPPI) are deductible. Travel-related costs go under travel expenses. Maintain agendas or confirmation emails to support the business purpose of attendance.

$

Books & Trade Publications

Photography books, trade journals, and business development reading are deductible if they directly relate to your business. These are ordinary educational expenses—track purchases and maintain usage logs if needed.

$

No State-Level Caps

Delaware honors all federally allowed education deductions. There’s no special credit or cap—expenses on your federal Schedule C automatically reduce your Delaware taxable income.

$

Marketing & Advertising Costs
-----------------------------

Deductions for marketing & advertising

Advertising & Promotion Expenses

Print ads, flyers, branded swag, and digital marketing like Google or Facebook ads are fully deductible. Maintain copies of promotional materials and receipts to validate business intent.

$

Website Design & Hosting

Costs for website development, hosting, domain registration, and email marketing services are fully deductible. Delaware has no sales tax, so in-state web services simplify deductions.

$

Online Listings & Subscriptions

Payments for wedding vendor directories, client galleries, and portfolio platforms are deductible. Save receipts and note business use. These services reduce your taxable income directly.

$

Branded Giveaways & Sponsorships

Promo items (like T-shirts or mugs with your logo) and sponsorship fees for community events are deductible if used to market your business. Maintain supporting documentation.

$

State Tax Treatment

Delaware treats all ordinary marketing expenses as fully deductible. No advertising tax applies, and services purchased in-state avoid sales tax, making cost tracking easier.

$

Business Insurance, Licensing & Permits
---------------------------------------

Deductions for insurance & licenses

Business Insurance Premiums

Premiums for general liability, professional liability, gear protection, studio renters insurance, or workers’ comp (if you have employees) are fully deductible. Pay through your business account and save invoices.

$

Specialized Insurance Policies

Event-based insurance, commercial auto policies, and additional coverage required by clients or venues are deductible. Only the business-use portion of personal insurance qualifies—track clearly.

$

Delaware Business License Fees

Delaware requires a $75/year license for your first business location and $25/year for additional locations. All business license fees are deductible as ordinary business expenses.

$

Transient Photographer Permits

Photographers without a fixed Delaware location must pay a $25/day transient permit when working in the state. These fees are deductible if related to business operations.

$

Gross Receipts Tax (GRT)

Delaware imposes a 0.3983% tax on gross revenue, after excluding the first $100,000/month. Though not deductible against GRT itself, the amount paid is deductible on income tax returns.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies (Business Use)
-----------------------------------------------------

Deductions for supplies & consumables

Props & Studio Set Pieces

Props like furniture, staging decor, or reusable accessories are deductible. Most items are expensed in the year of purchase unless unusually costly. Document business purpose and usage for each item.

$

Backdrops & Session Materials

Backdrops, set designs, seasonal decor, and session-specific materials are considered business supplies. Fully deductible if used for client work. Save receipts and shoot notes for backup.

$

Consumables & Session Supplies

Items like batteries, candles, smoke bombs, and cleaning wipes used during sessions are deductible. These are expensed as supplies. Maintain a record of session dates and use.

$

Office & Storage Supplies

Printer ink, hard drives, USBs, and cleaning kits used in business are fully deductible. Categorize purchases clearly in your records to avoid confusion with personal items.

$

Sales Tax Treatment

Delaware has no sales tax. If supplies are purchased out-of-state and taxed, that tax becomes part of the deductible purchase cost. Save full receipts with totals paid.

$

Bank Fees, Loan Interest & Financial Credits
--------------------------------------------

Deductions for financial expenses

Banking & Account Fees

Monthly business bank fees, wire transfers, ATM charges, and check order fees are fully deductible. Record fees in your books and retain bank statements for IRS and Delaware support.

$

Payment Processing Charges

Stripe, PayPal, Square, or credit card processor fees are deductible. These are considered merchant fees or business banking expenses. Reconcile 1099-Ks and gross receipts with deducted amounts.

$

Loan Interest & Credit Card Charges

Interest on loans or business credit cards is deductible—only the interest, not the principal. Deduct business-related loan origination fees or penalties if applicable. Keep loan statements.

$

Personal Loan Interest (Business Use)

If using personal credit for business purchases, allocate and deduct only the interest tied to business use. Maintain records clearly separating personal from business charges.

$

Delaware Gross Receipts Caution

Gross receipts tax is calculated before fees. Even if you deduct fees on income tax, Delaware GRT is based on total revenue received, not net after processor charges.
