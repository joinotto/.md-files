Equipment & Gear
----------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Equipment Purchases

You can deduct the full cost of cameras, lenses, computers, and gear using Section 179 or regular depreciation. Idaho allows Section 179 fully but disallows bonus depreciation. Track business use and file IRS Form 4562.

$

Small Equipment & De Minimis Expensing

Items under $2,500 (e.g., tripods, accessories) can be expensed under the IRS de minimis safe harbor. You do not need to depreciate low-cost purchases. Keep receipts and list items in your asset log with business use notes.

$

Production Sales Tax Exemption

If you sell physical prints, qualifying “production equipment” may be purchased tax-free in Idaho. Use Form ST-101 to claim the exemption. Digital-only photographers do not qualify and must pay 6% sales tax.

$

Investment Tax Credit (ITC)

You may claim a 3% credit on new or used equipment used ≥3 years. Idaho Form 49 is required. Excess credits carry forward 14 years and can offset up to 50% of income tax.

$

Business Personal Property Tax

Idaho exempts the first $250,000 of business property per county from tax. Most freelancers owe nothing. If over $250K, file an asset list with the assessor by March 15. Items < $3,000 are also exempt.

$

Studio/Office Rent, Utilities And Insurance
-------------------------------------------

Deductions for studio and office expenses

Studio Rent & Office Space

Rent for a studio or coworking space is fully deductible. Internet, water, and utilities are also write-offs. Idaho conforms to federal rules. Keep lease agreements and monthly bills to support the deduction on Schedule C, Line 20b or 27a.

$

Home Office Deduction (Simplified or Actual)

If you use a portion of your home exclusively for work, deduct based on size: either $5/sq ft (up to $1,500) or actual expenses via Form 8829. Idaho accepts the federal amount. Maintain space measurements and expense records.

$

Utilities & Services

Electricity, internet, phone bills, and cleaning costs tied to your workspace are deductible. Allocate by business-use percentage if home-based. Idaho follows federal treatment. Save utility bills and note how each supports business operations.

$

Studio Insurance & Business Coverage

Premiums for studio liability insurance, gear coverage, and property insurance are deductible. If working from home, deduct the business-use portion of homeowner’s or renter’s insurance. Idaho allows full deduction. Keep policy declarations and payment proof.

$

Local Permits or Fees (Idaho Specific)

City or county business registration fees for a home studio are deductible. Idaho has no statewide commercial occupancy tax. Fees tied to legal operation (e.g. a Boise home business permit) count as deductible business licenses.

$

Travel & Transportation Expenses
--------------------------------

Deductions for business-related travel and transportation

Vehicle Use (Standard Mileage or Actual Expenses)

Use your car for shoots or meetings? Deduct mileage at the IRS rate ($0.67/mile for 2024) or deduct a business-use % of gas, repairs, insurance, etc. Idaho follows federal rules. Keep a mileage log or receipts to prove usage.

$

Local Travel & Parking

Driving to client locations or job sites is deductible. Parking fees and tolls during business trips count too. Commuting from home to your main workplace is not deductible. Idaho mirrors federal rules. Log dates, miles, and trip purpose.

$

Airfare, Hotels & Out-of-Town Trips

Business travel costs – airfare, train, lodging, rental cars – are fully deductible. Idaho accepts these without adjustment. Save receipts and document business reasons for trips. Lodging must be for business; personal vacations don’t qualify.

$

Rideshare, Taxi & Local Transit

Uber, Lyft, or taxi fares used to get to shoots or meetings are deductible. Rental cars while traveling are also deductible. Idaho recognizes all transportation expenses related to business if documented.

$

State Considerations (Idaho)

Idaho doesn’t have a separate mileage rate or disallow federal travel deductions. Bonus depreciation on vehicles is not allowed, so adjust if claimed federally. Use Form 39R for adjustments. Fuel taxes are part of deductible costs, no extra steps.

$

Subcontractors & Assistants
---------------------------

Deductions for subcontractors and assistants

Freelancer & Assistant Payments (Contract Labor)

Payments to second shooters, editors, or assistants are fully deductible. Use Schedule C, line 11. Ensure they are true contractors, not employees. Idaho mirrors federal rules. Keep invoices, W-9s, and proof of payment.

$

1099-NEC Filing Requirement

If you pay any unincorporated contractor $600 or more during the year, file IRS Form 1099-NEC by Jan 31. Idaho requires submission if work was performed in-state. Use IRS Combined Federal/State Filing or send copy with Form 967

$

Proper Worker Classification

Contractors use their own tools and set their own schedules. If you control their work hours or they rely solely on you, they may be an employee. Misclassification can lead to penalties. Idaho follows IRS classification guidelines.

$

Recordkeeping

Maintain clear contracts or emails stating work scope, contractor’s info, and proof of payment (PayPal, Venmo, bank transfer). Even under-$600 jobs are deductible without 1099, just keep documentation.

$

Out-of-State Contractors

Paying a non-Idaho contractor for work in Idaho? Issue 1099-NEC, but no state tax withholding is required unless it’s a special case (like real estate or construction). Idaho taxes that income on the contractor’s return, not yours.

$

Training, Education & Professional Development
----------------------------------------------

Deductions for professional development and training

Work-Related Courses & Workshops

Education that maintains or improves your photography skills is deductible. This includes workshops, editing courses, lighting classes, or business seminars. Report under "Other Expenses" on Schedule C. Keep proof of relevance to your current business.

$

Professional Memberships & Subscriptions

Dues for photography groups (e.g., PPA), trade journals, and tutorial sites (like KelbyOne) are deductible. These support your professional development and are ordinary business expenses. Retain receipts or billing records.

$

Educational Travel Costs

If you travel for a workshop or seminar, airfare, hotel, and 50% of meals are deductible as business travel. Keep agendas and receipts showing the educational purpose. Local meals without overnight travel aren’t deductible.

$

Documentation & Schedule C Reporting

Maintain receipts, course syllabi, agendas, and notes on business benefit. Expenses can be listed as “Training/Education” or split among “Other,” “Office,” or “Travel” depending on type (e.g., course fee vs. hotel). No special IRS form is required.

$

Marketing, Advertising & Website
--------------------------------

Deductions for marketing and online presence

Digital & Print Advertising

Costs for online ads (Google, Instagram), printed flyers, business cards, and brochures are 100% deductible. This includes vendor site listings (e.g., The Knot), bridal show booths, and sponsored local events. Deduct under “Advertising” on Schedule C.

$

Marketing Services & Freelancers

Hiring a social media manager, copywriter, or designer for branding or ad content is deductible. If paying over $600, issue a 1099-NEC. These services are ordinary promotional expenses. Retain contracts or payment records.

$

Client Promotional Materials

Sample albums, branded USBs, lookbooks, or signage created to attract clients are deductible. Meals for client meetings are 50% deductible; refreshments for public promotional events may be 100%. Classify meals separately from advertising.

$

Documentation & Schedule C Reporting

List all costs on Schedule C, line 8 (“Advertising”). Website-related costs may go here or under “Other Expenses” if preferred. Keep ad receipts, screenshots, and proof of ad content or design work to justify deductions.

$

Business Insurance, Licensing & Permits
---------------------------------------

Deductions for business insurance, licensing & permits

Business Insurance Premiums

Premiums for general liability, equipment coverage, studio property insurance, and professional liability (E&O) are fully deductible. Allocate only the business-use portion if bundled with personal coverage. Report on Schedule C, line 15.

$

Home Office & Combo Policies

If you work from home and have a homeowner’s policy with a business rider, deduct only the portion attributable to your business. Request a premium breakdown or calculate based on insured value percentages.

$

Studio or Business Property Insurance

Coverage for a rented or owned studio, including fire, theft, and flood insurance, qualifies as a full deduction. If you have a business-use vehicle, commercial auto insurance is also deductible based on business use percentage.

$

Licenses, Permits & Fees

Deduct fees for business registration, DBA filing, LLC annual reports, and permits (e.g., city park shoot or vendor license). Report these on Schedule C, line 23 (“Taxes and Licenses”) or line 27a with a label if preferred.

$

Documentation & Forms

Keep insurance policy docs, declarations pages, licensing certificates, and permit receipts. Deduct small license fees in full; large multi-year licenses may need pro rata treatment depending on cost and duration.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies
--------------------------------------

Deductions for props, backdrops & consumable supplies

Photography Props & Backdrops

Items like backdrops, studio décor, costumes, and shoot-specific props are fully deductible as supplies if used within a year. If an item is over $2,500 or long-lived, consider Section 179 or depreciation treatment.

$

Consumable Supplies

Deduct printer ink, paper, USBs, memory cards, batteries, and cleaning tools as supplies. These are ordinary costs of delivering client work and maintaining gear. Most fall under the IRS de minimis safe harbor rule.

$

Office & Studio Supplies

Include pens, notebooks, hard drives, extension cords, and tools used for your studio or editing workflow. Report as “Supplies” on Schedule C, line 22 or under “Other expenses” with a custom label.

$

Inventory & Resold Items

Frames, albums, or printed products sold to clients may be treated as inventory and deducted under Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). For incidental sales, deduct when paid. If reselling, track inventory value.

$

Sales Tax & Exemptions (Idaho)

Frames, albums, or printed products sold to clients may be treated as inventory and deducted under Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). For incidental sales, deduct when paid. If reselling, track inventory value.

$

Business Personal Property Tax

Idaho exempts up to $250,000 of business personal property (per county) and all items under $3,000 (post-2013). This usually covers all props and supplies. No local filing is needed unless gear exceeds exemption limits.

$

Bank Fees, Loan Interest & Financial Expenses
---------------------------------------------

Deductions for bank fees, loan interest, and financial expenses

Bank Account Fees

Monthly service charges, check reorder costs, ATM withdrawal fees, and overdraft charges on your business bank account are fully deductible. Using a separate business account is recommended for clean records.

$

Merchant Processing Fees

Transaction fees from PayPal, Stripe, Square, or credit card processors are deductible. Always report gross client payments as income, then deduct the processor fees separately under “Merchant Fees” or “Bank Charges.”

$

Credit Card & Financing Charges

Interest and annual fees on business-use credit cards are deductible. If you use a mixed-use card, allocate interest based on the business-use percentage. Fees for loan origination, if small, can be expensed outright.

$

Sales/Use Tax Considerations

Idaho does not tax financial services or bank fees. If you finance equipment and paid sales tax on the item, include that tax in your equipment cost—not in interest. Use tax does not apply to financial charges

$

Payment Reporting (1099-K)

Platforms like Square or PayPal may send you a 1099-K for total payments processed. Be sure to deduct the processing fees to avoid overpaying tax on gross income reported.

$

Other Deductions & Niche Items
------------------------------

Deductions for other expenses and niche items

Self-Employment Tax Deduction

You can deduct half of your SE tax (the “employer” portion) on Form 1040. Though not shown on Schedule C, this reduces your AGI and lowers federal and Idaho income tax automatically.

$

Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction

Most sole proprietors get a 20% deduction on net business income (QBI), claimed on Form 8995. Idaho does not offer a state QBI deduction—your full business income is taxed for Idaho purposes.

$

Depreciation & Section 179 Recapture

Selling equipment that was fully depreciated or written off may trigger gain (recapture). Report sale price as income. Idaho generally mirrors federal rules but adjusts for any disallowed bonus depreciation.
