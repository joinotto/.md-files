Equipment & Gear

Cameras

Cameras used for business are deductible as capital expenses. You may depreciate them over their useful life or use Section 179 expensing. Hawaii only allows up to $25,000 in Section 179 expensing per year (much lower than the federal cap of $1,220,000), and does not allow federal bonus depreciation. Sales tax (GET) or use tax paid on equipment is included in your cost basis. If you qualify, you may also claim the Hawaii Capital Goods Excise Tax Credit (4%) for eligible equipment purchases, but not on amounts expensed under Section 179.

Lenses, lighting, drones, and stands

Lenses, flashes, strobes, drones, tripods, and stands are deductible as business equipment. Section 179 expensing is capped at $25,000 per year in Hawaii. Remaining costs are depreciated.

Home office deduction

If you use part of your home exclusively and regularly for business, you may deduct a portion of rent/mortgage, utilities, and insurance using IRS Form 8829 or the simplified method. Hawaii follows federal rules for the home office deduction, and the deduction flows to your Hawaii return.

Depreciation and Section 179
----------------------------

Section 179 expensing and depreciation

Hawaii allows only $25,000 per year in Section 179 expensing (much lower than the federal cap), and does not allow federal bonus depreciation. Any excess equipment cost must be depreciated over its useful life. Keep separate depreciation schedules for Hawaii and federal returns.

$

Capital Goods Excise Tax Credit (CGEC)

Hawaii offers a 4% Capital Goods Excise Tax Credit for qualifying business equipment purchases. You cannot claim this credit on amounts expensed under Section 179. Most photographers will use this for equipment that is depreciated rather than expensed.

$

State-Specific Tax Rules
------------------------

GET on digital goods and services

Hawaii GET applies to all gross receipts, including digital images delivered electronically, unlike most states. There is no sales tax exemption for resale; GET applies at the wholesale or retail rate depending on the transaction. Services, digital goods, and tangible goods are all subject to GET.

$

No resale exemption for GET

Hawaii does not allow a resale exemption for GET on purchases for resale (e.g., albums, frames). You pay GET when you buy and again when you sell, but at different rates (wholesale vs. retail).

$

Film/production tax credit

Hawaii offers a refundable film tax credit (22% on Oahu, 27% on Neighbor Islands) for qualifying productions with $100,000+ in local spend. This is generally for film/TV, not standard photography businesses. Compliance requires pre-registration, GET license, and workforce development contributions.

$

Record-Keeping and Compliance
-----------------------------

Documentation and IRS forms

Maintain receipts, invoices, mileage logs, travel records, proof of business use for home office, depreciation schedules, GET filings, and 1099s. Use Schedule C, Form 4562, Form 8829, and 1099-NEC as appropriate. Hawaii follows federal treatment for most deductions, but requires separate schedules for Section 179 and depreciation due to state limits.
