Affinity Photo is a powerful tool for photo editing, graphic design, and digital painting. To maximize your productivity and streamline your workflow, mastering the keyboard shortcuts is essential. This guide will walk you through the most useful shortcuts, enhancing both your speed and efficiency in Affinity Photo.

Why Use Shortcuts?
------------------

Using keyboard shortcuts can significantly speed up your workflow, allowing you to perform tasks more efficiently. Instead of searching through menus, you can execute commands swiftly. This not only saves time but also helps you stay immersed in your creative process without interruptions.

Common Affinity Photo Shortcuts
-------------------------------

### 1. Basic Navigational Shortcuts

*   Open Document: `Cmd + O` (Mac) / `Ctrl + O` (Windows)
*   New Document: `Cmd + N` (Mac) / `Ctrl + N` (Windows)
*   Save Document: `Cmd + S` (Mac) / `Ctrl + S` (Windows)

Familiarizing yourself with these basic shortcuts will ease the document management process.

### 2. Selection Tools

*   Select All: `Cmd + A` (Mac) / `Ctrl + A` (Windows)
*   Deselect: `Cmd + D` (Mac) / `Ctrl + D` (Windows)
*   Invert Selection: `Cmd + Shift + I` (Mac) / `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows)

These shortcuts are crucial for efficiently editing specific areas of your image without unnecessarily processing the whole document.

### 3. Editing Shortcuts
