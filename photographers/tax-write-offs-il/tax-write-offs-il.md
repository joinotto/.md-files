Equipment & Gear
----------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Photography Equipment

Cameras, lenses, lighting, and computers used >50% for business can be deducted via depreciation or Section 179. Section 179 lets you expense up to $1.22M in 2024, useful for immediate tax savings.

$

Small Tools & Safe Harbor

Items under $2,500 (like SD cards, cables, or light meters) can be expensed immediately under the IRS de minimis rule. Illinois allows this treatment, so no depreciation record is required for these.

$

Depreciation & Form 4562

If not using Section 179, gear is typically depreciated over 5 years using MACRS. This is filed with Form 4562 and reflected on Schedule C. Illinois requires adjustments only for bonus depreciation claims.

$

State Adjustment: Bonus Depreciation

Illinois does not conform to federal bonus depreciation. If you use it federally, you must add it back on Illinois Form IL-4562 and deduct regular depreciation instead over time.

$

Sales Tax & Basis Treatment

Sales tax on equipment is part of the asset’s basis and depreciated with it. Use tax paid on out-of-state purchases also adds to the basis but isn’t separately deductible.

$

Studio/Office Rent, Utilities & Insurance
-----------------------------------------

Deductions for studio and office expenses

Home Office Deduction

If you use a part of your home exclusively for photography work, you can deduct a portion of rent, mortgage interest, utilities, and insurance. Choose between actual expenses (Form 8829) or simplified method ($5/sq ft, max $1,500).

$

Exclusive Use Rule

The space must be used only for business (e.g., editing or client meetings). Occasional personal use disqualifies the deduction. Illinois follows IRS rules without any state-specific form or adjustment.

$

Depreciation for Homeowners

Homeowners can deduct depreciation for the business-use portion of their home. This reduces taxes now, but depreciation is recaptured when the house is sold. This rule also applies to Illinois returns.

$

Illinois Property Tax Credit Note

If you claim the home office deduction, part of your Illinois property taxes becomes a business expense, so that portion can’t be used for the personal property tax credit on your state return.

$

Rented Studio or Office

Rent for a studio or office outside your home is fully deductible, including related utilities, business internet, and insurance. Illinois accepts these deductions without requiring special treatment or forms.

$

Travel & Transportation
-----------------------

Deductions for travel and transportation expenses

Vehicle Use (Mileage or Actual Costs)

Deduct costs for driving to shoots, meetings, and errands using either the IRS standard mileage rate (67¢/mile for 2025) or actual vehicle expenses (fuel, insurance, repairs). Commuting from home to a studio is not deductible.

$

Business-Use Percentage Rule

If using actual costs, only deduct the portion of expenses tied to business use. For example, if 40% of your miles are business-related, only 40% of fuel, insurance, and depreciation are deductible. Keep a mileage log for proof.

$

Parking, Tolls & Public Transit

Parking fees, tolls, and fares for rideshares or public transit used for business trips are deductible in full, whether or not you use the mileage method. They are reported separately from mileage or vehicle costs.

$

Travel Expenses (Airfare, Lodging, Meals)

Costs for overnight business trips — flights, hotels, and 50% of meals — are deductible if the primary purpose is business. Save receipts and document the business reason. Illinois conforms to federal treatment.

$

Illinois-Specific Note

Illinois honors federal deductions for vehicle and travel costs, including the standard mileage rate. Bonus depreciation adjustments (if claimed) may require Illinois Form IL-4562, but otherwise no add-backs are required.

$

Contracted Labor & Assistants
-----------------------------

Deductions for contracted labor

Freelance Labor (Second Shooters, Assistants)

Paying contractors like second shooters, editors, or makeup artists is fully deductible as “Contract Labor” on Schedule C. No dollar cap, but ensure the services are strictly business-related and documented.

$

1099-NEC Requirement for $600+

If you pay any non-employee $600 or more during the year, issue Form 1099-NEC by January 31 of the following year. Collect W-9s upfront to gather Tax ID info. Even smaller payments are still deductible.

$

Employee vs. Contractor Classification

Be sure your helpers qualify as independent contractors. If they control how and when they work and use their own tools, they’re likely contractors. Misclassification can trigger audits and penalties.

$

Recordkeeping Requirements

Keep contracts, emails detailing the work, invoices, and proof of payment (Venmo receipts, checks, etc.). Both IRS and Illinois may review large “contract labor” deductions for legitimacy in an audit.

$

Illinois-Specific Note

Illinois conforms fully to federal rules on contract labor deductions. No state-specific tax or form is required for hiring contractors. Just report accurately on Schedule C and maintain good documentation.

$

Training & Professional Development
-----------------------------------

Deductions for training & professional development

Photography Workshops & Courses

Fees for photography-related education—like lighting workshops, editing classes, or online tutorials—are deductible if they enhance your current skills. Must be relevant to your existing business, not a new profession.

$

Industry Conferences & Seminars

Costs for attending events such as WPPI or PhotoPlus, including registration and educational sessions, are fully deductible. Travel costs to attend are claimed under travel, while conference fees go under education.

$

Professional Memberships & Subscriptions

Membership dues for groups like PPA, photography clubs, and subscriptions to educational content (e.g., Adobe tutorials or Lynda.com) are deductible. These support ongoing skill development or business operations.

$

Books, Supplies & Licensing Exams

Photography books, training guides, and even certification exam fees (like FAA drone license) qualify. These costs are typically reported as “Training and Education” or “Other Expenses” on Schedule C.

$

Marketing & Advertising
-----------------------

Deductions for marketing & advertising

Digital & Print Advertising

Expenses for Google Ads, Facebook boosts, Instagram promotions, print ads, flyers, brochures, and business cards are fully deductible. These directly support client acquisition and branding efforts.

$

Website & Online Tools

Domain fees, hosting charges, design templates, gallery platforms, and online booking tools (like HoneyBook or Pixieset) are all write-offs. Hiring web designers or SEO consultants also qualifies under advertising.

$

Trade Shows & Promotions

Booth fees, sample prints, signage, and promotional swag (shirts, mugs with logo) are deductible. Participation in bridal expos or local showcases also counts as a marketing expense.

$

Referral Fees & Networking Events

Commissions to planners or venues and networking event fees (if used to promote your services) are deductible. If meals are included, allocate only the marketing portion here—meals go under the 50% meal rule.

$

Business Insurance, Licensing & Permits
---------------------------------------

Deductions for insurance & licenses

Business Insurance Premiums

Deduct premiums for general liability, equipment coverage, professional indemnity (E&O), studio renter’s insurance, and the business-use portion of home or auto insurance. These are ordinary and necessary business expenses.

$

Licensing & Permits

Costs for business licenses, assumed name filings (DBAs), location permits, or sales tax permits are deductible. FAA Part 107 drone certification fees also qualify if drones are part of your photography services.

$

Business Formation & Renewal Fees

State LLC formation fees, annual renewal fees, and associated legal costs for entity setup are deductible. Alaska LLCs have a $250 formation fee and $100 biennial report; both are considered valid business write-offs.

$

Other Professional Fees

Any legal or service platform costs for maintaining compliance—like hiring someone to file your business paperwork—are included here. These go under “taxes & licenses” or “legal/professional fees” on Schedule C.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies (Business Use)
-----------------------------------------------------

Deductions for supplies & consumables

Photographic Props

Deduct the cost of items like chairs, flowers, signs, and staging décor used in client shoots. If under $2,500, most are expensed outright under the IRS de minimis rule rather than depreciated.

$

Backdrops & Scene Materials

Paper rolls, cloth backdrops, vinyl banners, and scene-builders used during sessions are considered supplies. These are fully deductible when purchased and typically don’t require depreciation.

$

Consumable Items & Replacements

Batteries, memory cards, lens wipes, printer ink, light bulbs, and camera cleaning kits qualify as supplies. Most are short-lived and easily expensed during the year of purchase.

$

Packaging & Delivery Materials

Costs for print boxes, USB drives, shipping envelopes, or branded tape used to deliver client products are business expenses. These support product delivery and are reported as supplies or COGS if applicable.

$

Other Financial Costs
---------------------

Deductions for financial expenses

Bank & Payment Processing Fees

Business checking fees, credit card processing charges (e.g., Stripe, Square), ATM fees for business cash, and payment gateway charges are deductible as part of regular banking costs.

$

Loan & Credit Card Interest

Interest paid on loans used for equipment, studio expenses, or general operations can be deducted. This includes interest on business credit cards and installment loans for photography gear.

$

Auto Loan Interest (Business Use)

If you financed a vehicle used in your business, you can deduct the portion of interest tied to business use. This is separate from mileage and must be prorated based on use.

$

Other Financial Charges

Includes overdraft charges, currency exchange fees (for international shoots), late finance charges (not IRS/penalties), or charges for transferring business funds between accounts.

$

Other State-Specific Deductions
-------------------------------

$
