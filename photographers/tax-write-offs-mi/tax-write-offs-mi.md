Equipment & Gear (Section 179 or Depreciation)
----------------------------------------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Equipment Purchases

You can deduct the full cost of photography equipment like cameras, lenses, and computers using Section 179 or depreciation. Michigan conforms to federal treatment, so no state adjustment is needed. Use IRS Form 4562 and keep business-use logs.

$

Small Equipment & De Minimis Expensing

Items under $2,500, such as tripods or SD cards, may be expensed immediately under the IRS de minimis rule. Michigan follows federal law here. Maintain receipts and usage records to support the deduction.

$

Sales Tax on Equipment

Sales tax paid on equipment is included in the cost basis and deducted through depreciation or Section 179. Michigan sales tax is 6%. If you buy gear out-of-state and do not pay sales tax, you must report and pay Michigan use tax.

$

Repairs & Rentals of Gear

Repairs like sensor cleanings or gear calibration are fully deductible. Equipment rentals are also deductible as business expenses. Michigan includes sales tax on repairs and rentals as part of the expense — no adjustment needed.

$

Software & Digital Tools

Image editing software (e.g., Adobe), online galleries, and cloud tools are deductible. Michigan follows federal rules for software costs. Electronically delivered software is tax-exempt in Michigan; physical media may be taxed.

$

Studio/Office Rent, Utilities & Insurance in Michigan
-----------------------------------------------------

Deductions for studio and office expenses

Studio or Office Rent & Utilities

If you rent a studio or office space for your photography business, rent and related utilities (electricity, water, internet) are fully deductible. Michigan does not impose a commercial rent tax. Simply deduct actual costs with no state-level adjustments.

$

Home Office Deduction

If you use part of your home exclusively for business, you can deduct related costs. Use the simplified ($5/sq ft) or actual expense method via IRS Form 8829. Michigan mirrors the federal deduction—whatever reduces your Schedule C income lowers your MI taxable income.

$

Business Insurance Premiums

Premiums for general liability, gear protection, and studio coverage are fully deductible. Michigan does not limit business insurance deductions and follows federal treatment. There is no sales tax on insurance premiums in MI.

$

Post Office Box & Storage Units

Renting a P.O. box or storage unit for business use is deductible. Keep receipts and note the business purpose. Michigan allows the full deduction—no special reporting required beyond your federal Schedule C.

$

Utility Allocation for Shared Spaces

If your studio or office shares space with personal use (e.g., a garage or basement studio), only the business-use portion of utilities and rent is deductible. Use a reasonable method to allocate costs. Michigan follows the same rule as the IRS.

$

Travel & Transportation in Michigan
-----------------------------------

Deductions for travel and transportation expenses

Vehicle Expenses (Standard Mileage or Actual Costs)

Photographers using a personal or business vehicle for client shoots, meetings, or delivery can deduct costs. Use either the IRS standard mileage rate ($0.67/mile for 2024) or actual expenses based on business use percentage. Michigan follows federal treatment—no additional state adjustment.

$

Travel Away from Home (Airfare, Lodging, Meals)

When traveling for business—like destination shoots or workshops—you can deduct airfare, hotel, taxis, and 50% of business meals. Michigan respects the federal rules, including per diem usage. Just ensure the trip is primarily for business to qualify.

$

Business Meals (Client Meetings, Shoots)

Meals during client meetings or long shoots are 50% deductible under federal rules. Michigan conforms to the 50% limitation with no separate adjustments. Document who was present and the business purpose of each meal.

$

Parking, Tolls & Local Transport

Parking fees, tolls, and rideshare fares for business errands are fully deductible. Maintain logs or receipts. Michigan allows these deductions in full with no special restrictions—whatever you deduct federally reduces your MI taxable income.

$

Vehicle Depreciation & Lease Deductions

If you own or lease a vehicle used in business, depreciation or lease payments can be deducted proportionally. Bonus depreciation is allowed federally and also honored by Michigan. Just retain records of mileage splits and payment documents.

$

Contracted Labor & Assistants
-----------------------------

Deductions for contracted labor

Contract Labor (Second Shooters, Freelancers)

Paying independent contractors like second shooters, editors, or stylists is fully deductible. Report payments over $600 via Form 1099-NEC. Michigan conforms to federal rules—these labor expenses reduce state income with no separate adjustment.

$

W-9 and 1099 Compliance

Collect a Form W-9 before paying contractors. Issue 1099-NEC by January 31 for payments ≥ $600. Michigan does not require separate 1099 filings, but you must maintain federal compliance. Misclassification of workers can trigger MI audits and penalties.

$

Employee vs. Contractor Distinction

Ensure your workers meet independent contractor criteria—freelancers set their own schedule, provide tools, and work independently. Employees require payroll compliance. Michigan applies the same classification test used by the IRS.

$

Proof of Work & Payment

Save contracts, email agreements, invoices, and payment confirmations. Label the work clearly (e.g., “Editing for XYZ wedding”). These are crucial for both federal and Michigan income tax compliance and substantiation.

$

No State Withholding Requirement

Michigan does not require state tax withholding on contractor payments. You are only responsible for issuing 1099s and reporting deductions correctly. For incorporated contractors, 1099s are generally not required, but expenses remain deductible.

$

Training & Professional Development in Michigan
-----------------------------------------------

Deductions for training & professional development

Workshops, Courses & Skill Development

You can deduct costs for courses, webinars, and workshops that improve your current photography skills (e.g., lighting techniques, marketing for creatives). Michigan follows federal rules—these are fully deductible if related to your existing business.

$

Travel for Educational Events

Travel costs for qualifying business education (airfare, lodging, meals) are deductible as business travel. Michigan honors these deductions as long as they’re valid on your federal return. Keep receipts and a clear link to your business activities.

$

Professional Subscriptions & Resources

Subscriptions to industry magazines, photography journals, or online content platforms (like PPA or Fstoppers) are deductible. Michigan allows the same treatment—no additional state adjustments. Save receipts and match the subscription to your trade.

$

Certification & Exam Fees

Fees for photography certifications like CPP or any business-related credentialing are deductible. Michigan accepts these deductions with no limits or credits of its own. Exams must relate to your current profession, not a new one.

$

Documentation & Purpose Proof

Save course syllabi, confirmation emails, and payment records. Annotate why each training is necessary for your business. If challenged in an audit, Michigan expects the same substantiation the IRS does—clear linkage to your active photography trade.

$

Marketing & Advertising
-----------------------

Deductions for marketing & advertising

Advertising & Promotion Expenses

Costs for online ads (Google, Meta), printed flyers, business cards, and listing fees (e.g., The Knot) are fully deductible. Michigan conforms to federal rules—these expenses lower your taxable income without additional forms or limits.

$

Photography Website Costs

Domain fees, web hosting, portfolio platforms (like Pixieset), and web design costs are deductible. Michigan treats these as regular business deductions. Digital-only services like hosting and email marketing aren’t subject to MI sales tax.

$

Promotional Events & Giveaways

Trade show booths, banners, and branded swag are considered marketing expenses. Michigan allows these as deductions. If printed in-state, 6% MI sales tax may apply, but it’s part of the deductible expense. Save receipts and design invoices.

$

Client Gifts (Promotional or Thank-You)

Client gifts are deductible up to $25 per recipient annually. Michigan aligns with federal rules—track gift purpose and amounts. Promotional items with your branding used at scale (e.g., pens or prints) may count as marketing, not gifts.

$

Social Media & Email Marketing Tools

Subscriptions to Mailchimp, Buffer, or other outreach tools qualify as marketing costs. Michigan does not add back these expenses—they’re treated like other federal business deductions. Save digital invoices for proper recordkeeping.

$

Business Insurance, Licensing & Permits
---------------------------------------

Deductions for insurance & licenses

Business Insurance Premiums

Policies like general liability, gear coverage, or professional indemnity are fully deductible. Michigan follows federal treatment—these reduce taxable income directly. Insurance on your studio space or business-use portion of auto insurance is also eligible.

$

Studio or Gear Insurance

Premiums for insuring rented studio space or valuable camera equipment are deductible. If bundled with a personal homeowner policy, allocate and deduct the business-use portion. Michigan does not limit or adjust these deductions.

$

Licenses, Permits & Regulatory Fees

Business registration fees, city permits for shoots, or sales tax licenses are deductible. Michigan charges an annual LLC filing fee (e.g., $25 for most) that qualifies. No separate state credit applies, but these are valid business expenses.

$

Legal & Accounting Fees

Attorney or CPA costs related to setting up your business, drafting contracts, or preparing taxes are deductible. Michigan allows all federally claimed professional service fees. Keep invoices that specify business vs. personal services.

$

Trademarks, Copyrights & Filings

Registration fees for copyrights, trademarks, and logos are business expenses. These are deductible under federal rules and flow through to Michigan returns. If the fee covers a multi-year license, you may need to amortize it.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies (Business Use)
-----------------------------------------------------

Deductions for supplies & consumables

Props, Sets & Studio Backdrops

Items like furniture, fabrics, paper rolls, or themed props for shoots are deductible as supplies. Michigan conforms to federal rules—expenses reduce taxable income. If items are resold to clients, collect and remit 6% Michigan sales tax.

$

Consumable Studio Supplies

Supplies such as batteries, gaffer tape, lens wipes, light bulbs, and cleaning products are fully deductible. These short-life items are expensed in the year of purchase. Michigan allows full deduction; any sales tax paid becomes part of the expense.

$

Client-Use Items (Makeup, Wardrobe)

Products like makeup kits or wardrobe pieces provided for shoots count as business expenses. Keep receipts and document use. Michigan follows federal treatment—these reduce income directly and require no special state adjustment.

$

Printing & Packaging Costs

Printing albums, ordering framed photos, or delivering USBs to clients are deductible. Michigan requires sales tax to be collected on tangible deliverables like prints or albums. Printing expenses are deducted even if reimbursed by clients.

$

Inventory vs Supplies

If you stock products like frames or albums for resale, track them as inventory. Most freelancers use just-in-time orders and expense the cost directly. Michigan mirrors federal treatment and does not impose additional accounting burdens.

$

Bank Fees, Loan Interest & Other Financial Expenses
---------------------------------------------------

Deductions for financial expenses

Business Loan & Credit Interest

Interest on business loans, credit lines, and equipment financing is fully deductible. Michigan conforms to federal rules—deductible interest on Schedule C flows through with no adjustment. Keep statements showing business-use purpose and interest amounts.

$

Credit Card & Financing Charges

Annual fees and interest on business-use credit cards are deductible. For mixed-use cards, allocate by business percentage. Michigan respects federal treatment; these deductions reduce both federal and Michigan taxable income without changes.

$

Bank & Merchant Account Fees

Monthly bank fees, ATM charges, and payment processor fees (Stripe, PayPal, Square) are deductible. These reduce your net profit. Michigan fully conforms—no separate add-back or disallowance. Save transaction records or annual fee summaries.

$

Financial Software & Tax Prep Costs

Software like QuickBooks, invoicing apps, and the business portion of tax prep fees (e.g. Schedule C support) are deductible. Michigan follows federal reporting; just deduct the business portion. No extra credits or limitations apply.
