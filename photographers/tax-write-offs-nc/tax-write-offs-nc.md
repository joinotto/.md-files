Equipment & Gear
----------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera, Gear & Computer Purchases

Deduct camera gear via Section 179 or depreciation. NC caps Section 179 at $25K and disallows federal bonus depreciation. Excess 179 or bonus amounts must be added back at 85%, then deducted over 5 years.

$

Section 179 & Bonus Depreciation

Elect Section 179 on Form 4562 if gear is used >50% for business. NC requires 85% add-back of amounts over $25K. Bonus depreciation (e.g. 80% federal) is not allowed in NC—spread 85% add-back over 5 years.

$

Sales Tax & Use Tax

NC gear purchases are subject to 4.75% + local sales tax. Out-of-state gear must report equivalent use tax. Include tax in cost basis—it increases deductible amount via depreciation or Section 179 expensing.

$

Privilege License Repeal

As of July 1, 2024, NC no longer requires photographers to pay the $50 annual state privilege license tax. If paid in early 2024, it remains deductible. No license obligation going forward.

$

Vehicle Expenses
----------------

Deductions for vehicle expenses

Standard Mileage vs. Actual Cost

Use IRS mileage rate (67¢/mile for 2024) or deduct actual auto costs based on business-use %. NC follows federal rules, but Section 179/bonus depreciation require 85% add-back for NC returns if used.

$

Heavy Vehicles & SUVs

Section 179 allows large deductions for heavy SUVs (>6,000 lbs GVWR). NC limits Section 179 and requires add-back for depreciation over $25K. Business-use % must be justified—avoid claiming 100% unless you own another car.

$

Property Tax & Sales Tax

Deduct business-use % of annual vehicle property tax on Schedule C. NC highway use tax (3%) adds to the vehicle’s cost basis. Cannot deduct sales tax separately—include it in basis for depreciation.

$

Trips to regular work locations are non-deductible commuting. Drives from home office to client sites count as business miles. NC follows federal commuting rules with no additional restrictions or adjustments.

$

Business Travel
---------------

Deductions for business-related travel

Travel Costs & Deductions

Out-of-town shoots qualify for deductions: airfare, hotel, taxis, and 50% of meal costs. NC allows full deduction per federal rules. Save receipts and document the business purpose of every trip.

$

Personal Travel Mix

If a trip combines business and personal time, allocate expenses. Only the business portion is deductible. NC does not alter federal split rules but expects good documentation in the event of audit.

$

Incidental Travel Costs

Deduct tips, baggage fees, business calls, and laundry during work travel. Partial personal expenses (like a hotel spa charge) must be excluded. NC allows full deduction as long as business connection is clear.

$
