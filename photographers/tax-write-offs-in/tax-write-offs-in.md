Equipment & Gear Essentials
---------------------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Equipment Purchases (Section 179 or Depreciation)

Cameras, lenses, lighting, and computers used for photography can be written off under Section 179 or depreciation. Indiana caps Section 179 expensing at $25,000 and disallows federal bonus depreciation. Keep Form 4562 and maintain an Indiana-specific depreciation log.

$

Software & Editing Tools

Editing software, cloud services, and plugins like Adobe CC are deductible. Subscriptions are expensed annually. Indiana treats software like other equipment—Section 179 deductions over $25K must be added back and recovered via regular depreciation on state returns.

$

Small Equipment & Supplies (De Minimis Rule)

Props, accessories, and tools under $2,500 per item may be fully expensed under the de minimis rule. Indiana conforms with this treatment. Sales tax paid is included in the cost and deducted with the purchase.

$

Leased & Rented Equipment

Costs to rent or lease gear (e.g., lenses, lighting) are fully deductible. No depreciation is needed. Indiana allows this deduction with no separate treatment—report as a direct business expense on Schedule C.

$

Depreciation Tracking & Add-Back Adjustments

Indiana requires separate tracking for equipment that exceeds federal Section 179 thresholds or uses bonus depreciation. Maintain two depreciation schedules—one for federal, one for Indiana—to ensure proper long-term expense tracking and compliance.

$

Studio/Office Expenses
----------------------

Deductions for studio and office expenses

Studio or Office Rent & Utilities

Rent for a studio or dedicated workspace is fully deductible. Utilities like electricity, internet, and insurance tied to that space are also deductible. Indiana has no extra rules—these flow through from your federal Schedule C. Rent isn’t subject to Indiana sales tax.

$

Home Office Deduction (In-home Studio)

A home office used exclusively and regularly for business is deductible using either the simplified or actual expense method. Indiana conforms to federal rules—Form 8829 deductions flow directly into Indiana returns with no add-back, including property tax portions.

$

Utilities & Overhead Costs

Expenses such as heating, water, and internet are deductible if tied to your studio. For shared home use, prorate based on business use percentage. Indiana accepts these as ordinary business expenses; no additional limitations apply.

$

Business Property Insurance

Insurance premiums for studio space or contents, including renters insurance and liability coverage, are fully deductible. Indiana allows full deduction of these costs—no add-back or separate treatment is required.

$

Renter Deduction Coordination

Indiana offers a personal renter deduction (up to $3,000), but you can not double-dip. If part of your rent is deducted as a business expense, only the personal portion may be used for the Indiana personal deduction. Keep clear records of allocation.

$

Travel & Transportation in Indiana
----------------------------------

Deductions for travel and transportation expenses

Local Vehicle Use & Mileage Deduction

Business driving (e.g. to shoots, client meetings) is deductible using the IRS standard mileage rate (67¢/mile for 2024) or actual expenses. Indiana fully conforms—deductions flow through Schedule C. Bonus depreciation on vehicles must be added back at the state level.

$

Actual Vehicle Expense Option

You may deduct a business-use percentage of fuel, maintenance, insurance, and depreciation. Indiana follows federal guidelines but disallows bonus depreciation, so create a separate “Indiana” depreciation schedule for the difference.

$

Parking, Tolls & Rideshare

Parking fees, tolls, taxis, ride-hailing (Uber, Lyft), and local transport used for client work are deductible. Indiana accepts these write-offs as-is with no limitations. Keep receipts and logs to substantiate business purpose.

$

Out-of-Town Business Travel

Travel expenses for client jobs, conferences, or workshops (airfare, hotels, transport, baggage) are fully deductible. Meals are 50% deductible. Indiana follows federal rules and honors all qualified business travel expenses.

$

Business Meals While Traveling

Meals with clients or during travel are 50% deductible. Indiana matches the federal 50% limit—if you deducted 100% in 2021–2022, Indiana required an add-back. As of 2023+, just apply the 50% rule uniformly.

$

Subcontractors & Assistants Deductions
--------------------------------------

Deductions for contracted labor

Freelance Assistants & Second Shooters

Paying second shooters, lighting assistants, editors, or freelancers is deductible under “Contract Labor” on Schedule C. Indiana fully honors these write-offs with no add-backs or state limitations. Keep W-9s and issue 1099-NEC for payments ≥$600/year.

$

Outsourced Editing & Online Services

Fees paid to online editors or platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or retouching labs are deductible. Indiana follows federal rules and allows full deduction. Keep invoices or contracts and match payments to work delivered.

Employee Wages & Payroll Taxes

If you employ staff, wages and employer-paid payroll taxes (e.g. Social Security, Medicare, Indiana unemployment) are deductible. Indiana imposes no franchise tax on having employees and fully accepts these deductions.

$

Worker Classification Compliance

Indiana follows federal contractor vs. employee guidelines. Misclassification can trigger penalties. Keep contracts, invoices, and proof of independent status (e.g. multiple clients) to validate contractor treatment.

$

$

---------------------------------

Deductions for training & professional development

$

Limitations on Personal Education

$

Professional Membership Dues

Memberships in photography associations (e.g. PPA), local business networks, or creative guilds are deductible. Indiana does not impose any restrictions, provided the membership is business-related. Charitable portions may be handled separately.

$

Marketing & Advertising Costs

$

$

Health Insurance (Self-Employed)

If you're self-employed, your personal health insurance premiums are deductible on your federal 1040 (above-the-line). Indiana accepts this deduction since it lowers your AGI. It doesn’t go on Schedule C but still lowers state income.

$

Business licenses, local vendor permits, trade name filings (DBA), and LLC fees are deductible. Indiana allows all business registration and permit costs without adjustment. Just separate these from non-deductible income taxes.

Indiana does not charge a fee for registering for sales tax, but any incidental costs (e.g., expedited filings) are deductible. These expenses are considered administrative and are allowed without add-backs on Indiana returns.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies (Business Use)
-----------------------------------------------------

Deductions for supplies & consumables

Photography Props & Scene Items

Items like backdrops, studio furniture, fabrics, or decorative props used in shoots are deductible. Indiana conforms to federal expensing rules. Props are typically expensed the year purchased unless they’re high-cost, in which case depreciate.

$

Consumable Supplies (Batteries, Paper, Cables)

Frequent-use supplies such as batteries, memory cards, gaffer tape, cleaning wipes, or ink are fully deductible. Indiana allows these deductions with no state adjustments. Sales tax paid on these items is included in your deductible expense.

Pens, folders, printer paper, stamps, and mailing supplies are ordinary business expenses. Indiana respects these write-offs and requires no additional forms. Retain receipts for substantiation if these costs are reviewed during audit.

$

Small Equipment & Tools

$
