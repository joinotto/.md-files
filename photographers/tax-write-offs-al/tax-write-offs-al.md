Equipment & Gear
----------------

Deduct the cost of your professional equipment and essential accessories as allowed by Alabama and federal law.

Cameras, lenses, computers, lighting

Alabama fully conforms to federal tax law for business equipment deductions. All cameras, lenses, lighting, drones, computers, and related gear are deductible as business expenses. You can depreciate these over their useful life or use Section 179 expensing (up to $1,220,000 in 2025) to deduct the full cost in the year of purchase. Alabama does not allow federal bonus depreciation, so if you claim it federally, you must adjust your state return. Sales tax paid on equipment (4% state plus local rates) can be included in your cost basis or, if you itemize, deducted on federal Schedule A.

Accessories and consumables

Memory cards, batteries, chargers, cleaning kits, camera bags, printer ink, and photo paper are deductible in the year purchased as supplies. These are expensed, not depreciated, and Alabama follows federal treatment.

Software and subscriptions

Deduct business-related software (Adobe Creative Cloud, Lightroom, Capture One) and cloud storage or gallery subscriptions as ordinary business expenses in the year paid. Alabama follows federal rules.

Studio or Office Space
----------------------

Deduct expenses for your physical studio or home office used for business.

Studio rent and utilities

Rent for studio space and related utilities (electricity, internet, phone) are deductible for Alabama income tax, as Alabama starts with federal taxable income. Storage space for props and equipment is also deductible. Alabama follows federal treatment.

$

Home office deduction

If you use part of your home exclusively and regularly for business, deduct a portion of your rent/mortgage, utilities, and insurance. Calculate this on IRS Form 8829 or use the simplified method. Alabama honors the federal calculation; no separate state form is required.

$

Business insurance

Premiums for liability, equipment, and errors & omissions insurance are deductible as business expenses. Alabama does not impose special insurance taxes on small business owners beyond the premiums.

$

Travel and Transportation
-------------------------

Deduct business travel and transportation costs for shoots and meetings.

Mileage, airfare, lodging, meals

Alabama follows federal rules for travel expense deductions. Miles driven for shoots are deductible at the IRS mileage rate ($0.67/mile for 2025). Airfare, lodging, and 50% of business meals are also deductible. All these deductions flow from your federal return to your Alabama return. Maintain a mileage log and receipts as documentation.

$

Subcontractors and Assistants
-----------------------------

Deduct payments to second shooters, editors, and freelance support.

Second shooters, assistants, editors

Payments to second shooters or assistants are deductible. Issue a 1099-NEC federally for payments of $600+; Alabama does not require a separate state 1099 filing. If you hire employees, you’ll need an Alabama state tax ID for withholding, but for independent contractors, maintain clear records. Alabama mirrors federal definitions for contractors vs. employees.

Training, Education, and Professional Development
-------------------------------------------------

Deduct costs to improve your skills and stay current in the industry.

Workshops, education, memberships

Training, workshops, and professional development costs are deductible for Alabama if deductible federally. This includes travel to out-of-state events. Alabama treats these as ordinary business expenses, with no special state credits or limits.

Deduct costs to promote your business and attract clients.

Liability and equipment insurance

Licensing, Permits, and Professional Fees

Deduct business license, permit, and professional service fees.

Business privilege license, permits, professional fees

Alabama photographers must obtain a state or county business privilege license to operate in many areas; the fee is deductible. City permits (e.g., for shooting in a city park) and professional fees (legal, CPA, tax prep) are also deductible. See Alabama Code § 40-12-140 for license fee amounts.

Props, Backdrops, and Consumable Supplies
-----------------------------------------

Deduct props, backdrops, albums, and supplies used in your business.

Props, backdrops, albums, supplies

Props, backdrops, printer ink, photo paper, and albums are deductible as supplies. If you purchase props or print supplies for resale, use a resale certificate to avoid Alabama sales tax at purchase and collect sales tax when you sell to your client. Photographers are not eligible for manufacturing exemptions on equipment.

Deduct financial fees and interest paid for business accounts or loans.

Bank fees and loan interest

Alabama-Specific Tax Laws and Exemptions
----------------------------------------

Understand unique Alabama tax rules for photographers.

Sales tax on tangible and digital photographs

Alabama levies sales tax (4% state plus local rates) on all tangible personal property sold to customers, including prints, albums, and photo books. Digital files delivered electronically are also considered tangible property and are taxable in Alabama. Services (session fees, editing, sitting fees) are not taxed if separately stated on the invoice; otherwise, the full package may be taxable. Use a resale certificate for items you resell to clients. Licensing fees for photo usage (digital images) are generally not subject to sales tax if no tangible product is delivered.

$

Home office deduction

Alabama does not have special home office rules beyond federal. The home office deduction you claim federally will carry into Alabama since it flows from the business income.

$

Business classification

No special classification for photographers in Alabama tax code; file as a sole proprietor, LLC, or corporation as appropriate. Ensure you have the required Alabama business license and a sales tax account if selling taxable items.
