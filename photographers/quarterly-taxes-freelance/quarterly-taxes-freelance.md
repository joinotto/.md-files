Understanding Quarterly Taxes for Freelance Photographers
---------------------------------------------------------

Freelancers make estimated IRS payments based on expected annual income. Without regular [withholding](https://joinotto.com/tax/wht), they must pay income and self-employment taxes quarterly to avoid penalties and ensure compliance.

Who Needs to Pay Quarterly Taxes?
---------------------------------

Self-employed photographers owing more than $1,000 after withholdings must make quarterly payments. This ensures even tax distribution to avoid a large end-of-year bill.

How to Determine Your Tax Obligations
-------------------------------------

Estimate your income and expenses. Use IRS Form 1040-ES to calculate your tax rate based on [net income](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/net-income-formula). Deductible expenses like equipment and supplies can reduce your taxable income. Consulting a tax professional can clarify your situation.

Calculating Estimated Taxes
---------------------------

Estimate your income and expenses using IRS Form 1040-ES. Start with your [gross income](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/gross-income), subtract eligible [deductions](https://joinotto.com/tax/tax-deductions), and apply the tax rate. Adjust calculations if your income fluctuates during the year.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Calculating Your Estimated Taxes

1.   **Estimate Annual Income**: Include all freelance photography income, such as session fees and print sales.
2.   **Subtract Business Expenses**: Deduct expenses like equipment, travel, marketing, and office supplies to find net profit.
3.   **Calculate Self-Employment Tax**: Multiply net profit by 92.35% and then by the 15.3% tax rate. 
    *   **Example**: 
        *   Net Profit: $50,000
        *   Taxable Earnings: $50,000 × 92.35% = $46,175
        *   Self-Employment Tax: $46,175 × 15.3% = $7,062.78

4.   **Determine Federal Income Tax**: Subtract half of the self-employment tax from net profit for AGI. Apply your tax bracket rate. 
    *   **Example**: 
        *   AGI: $50,000 - ($7,062.78 ÷ 2) = $46,468.61
        *   22% Tax Bracket: $46,468.61 × 22% = $10,223.09

5.   **Add Self-Employment and Income Taxes**: Total tax obligation is the sum of self-employment and income taxes. 
    *   **Total Estimated Tax**: $7,062.78 + $10,223.09 = $17,285.87

6.   **Divide into Quarterly Payments**: Divide total tax by four for quarterly payment amount. 
    *   **Quarterly Payment**: $17,285.87 ÷ 4 = $4,321.47

7.   **Adjust for State Taxes**: Add applicable state and local taxes to your payments.
