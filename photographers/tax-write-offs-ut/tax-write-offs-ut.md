Equipment & Gear
----------------

Deductions for photography equipment and related gear

Camera & Equipment Purchases (Section 179 or Depreciation)

You can deduct the full cost of cameras, lenses, and gear using Section 179 or bonus depreciation. Utah conforms to federal rules, so you can write off most purchases immediately. Use IRS Form 4562 and keep a business-use log.

$

Small Equipment & Supplies

Items under $2,500 like tripods, cables, or memory cards can be expensed under the de minimis rule. Utah follows federal treatment—no separate rule needed. Maintain receipts and note business usage.

$

Sales Tax & Use Tax on Equipment

Photographers pay Utah sales tax on equipment purchases. If buying gear online without sales tax, pay Utah use tax via TC-40. Sales tax paid is part of your deductible cost basis.

$

Business Personal Property Tax

Utah counties assess personal property tax on gear. If your total business property is under $29,300 in value (per county), apply for an exemption. If over, file with the county assessor and deduct taxes paid.

$

Home Office & Studio Expenses
-----------------------------

Deductions for home office and studio expenses

Home Office Deduction

Use the simplified method ($5/sq ft up to $1,500) or actual expense method for a home office used exclusively and regularly for business. Report on IRS Form 8829. Utah allows this via federal AGI.

$

Studio Rent & Utilities

External studio rent, utilities, and insurance are fully deductible business expenses. Utah treats these the same—no separate forms or add-backs.

$

Exclusivity & Records

Home office must be exclusive and your principal place of business. Keep floorplans, expense receipts, and square footage calculations for audit support.

$

Vehicle & Mileage
-----------------

Deductions for vehicle and mileage expenses

Standard Mileage vs. Actual Expenses

Deduct $0.67/mile (2024 rate) or claim a portion of actual auto costs (gas, repairs, depreciation). Pick one method per vehicle per year. Utah mirrors federal treatment—no adjustments required.

$

Sales Tax & Fuel

Gas includes Utah fuel tax; repairs are taxable. These are deductible if using actual expense methods. Track total and business miles for percentage use.

$

Registration & Vehicle Ownership

If a business owns the vehicle, register it commercially and deduct uniform fees or property tax as business expenses.

$

Travel & Lodging
----------------

Deductions for travel and lodging expenses

Out-of-Town Business Travel

Travel for shoots, workshops, or client jobs is deductible—covering flights, lodging, taxis, and tips. Only business-related days count; prorate mixed trips. Utah accepts these without changes.

$

Client Reimbursement & Sales Tax

If you bill clients for travel (hotel, airfare), the total charge is subject to Utah sales tax. List this carefully on invoices and retain all receipts.

$

Documentation

Keep itineraries, proof of business purpose, and receipts for travel expenses. Both the IRS and Utah require solid records.

$

Meals & Entertainment
---------------------

Deductions for meals and entertainment expenses

Business Meals (50% Deductible)

Meals with clients or while traveling are 50% deductible. Must be directly related to business, not lavish, and include who/what/when/why. Utah follows this federal rule exactly.

$

Entertainment Not Deductible

Entertainment (concerts, sports) is not deductible. Utah also denies deductions for entertainment in line with federal treatment.

$

Client Billed Meals & Tax

If you pass meal costs to clients, include them in your invoice and collect Utah sales tax. The original expense is still 50% deductible.

$

Supplies & Printing
-------------------

Deductions for supplies and printing expenses

Consumables & Supplies

Ink, paper, packaging, cleaning gear, and USB drives are deductible in the year purchased. Allocate personal vs. business use if shared.

$

Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

If delivering albums or prints, deduct COGS per job. Include lab invoices, materials, and related costs. Match expenses with client income.

$

Sales Tax Exemption for Resale

Use Form TC-721 to buy photo paper, albums, or frames tax-free for resale. Utah allows resale exemption if items are transferred to clients.

$

Non-Resale Supplies Taxed

Props, tools, or test prints are not exempt and sales tax applies. Deduct total paid including tax. Use tax may apply if you bought items tax-free but used them personally.

$

Advertising & Marketing
-----------------------

Deductions for advertising and marketing expenses

Advertising & Promotion

Website costs, printed materials, online ads, and design services are fully deductible. Client gifts (limit $25) and giveaway items also qualify.

$

Sales Tax on Promo Goods

Promo items like branded T-shirts or mugs are taxed at purchase. Deduct full cost including sales tax. Digital ads and website services are not taxed in Utah.

$

Barter Rules

If you exchange photos for ad space, report the value as income and expense—deduct the advertising expense and include bartered value as income.

$

Insurance & Professional Services
---------------------------------

Deductions for insurance and professional services

Business Insurance Premiums

Deduct premiums for liability, equipment, and business vehicle insurance. Self-employed health insurance goes on your 1040, not Schedule C.

$

Legal & Accounting Services

Attorney fees, CPA costs, and other consulting fees are fully deductible. Utah does not tax these services and follows federal deductions.

$

Memberships & Dues

Photography association dues are deductible. Utah does not tax these memberships, and they reduce taxable income like other professional costs.

$

Education & Subscriptions
-------------------------

Deductions for education and subscriptions

Skill Improvement & Training

Workshops, online classes, and photo education related to your business are deductible. Not valid for switching careers. Track enrollment fees and travel tied to learning.

$

Subscriptions & Software

Trade magazines, stock photo memberships, and software like Adobe Creative Cloud are deductible. Utah may tax some digital services like Creative Cloud—include sales tax in your deduction.

$

No Utah-Specific Credits

Utah offers no special credits for business education. Deduct these expenses on Schedule C, and they’ll flow through your Utah return.

$

Licenses, Fees & Taxes
----------------------

Deductions for licenses, fees & taxes

Permits & Business Licenses

City or county licenses, park shoot permits, LLC renewal fees, and business name filings are deductible. Utah’s $20 LLC renewal fee counts.

Business Property Taxes

Paying tax on gear or studio property is deductible. Utah county property tax must be tracked and reported if gear exceeds exemption limits.

$

State & SE Tax Not Deductible

You can’t deduct Utah or federal income tax on Schedule C. Self-employment tax is partially deductible—but not as a business expense.

$

SALT Workaround – PTET Election

S-Corps or partnerships may elect to pay Utah income tax at entity level, making it federally deductible. Sole props can’t use this option.

$

Sales Tax Compliance

You must collect and remit sales tax on physical deliverables. Keep exemption certificates and pay use tax where applicable.
