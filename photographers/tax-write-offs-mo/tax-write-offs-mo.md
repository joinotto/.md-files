Home Office (Business Use of Home)

If your studio is in your home, deduct costs based on square footage. Choose the simplified or actual-expense method. Missouri allows both. Depreciation reduces basis and may trigger recapture if you sell the home.

-----------------------------

Deductions for contracted labor

Contracted Labor (Second Shooters, Assistants, Editors)

Payments to non-employees like editors or second shooters are deductible. Issue Form 1099-NEC if paying $600+. Missouri does not require additional withholding. Maintain W-9s, contracts, and payment records for each contractor.

$

Client-Paid Subcontractor Work

If client projects include work from freelancers (e.g., $500 second shooter in a $2,000 package), deduct the subcontractor cost. Missouri taxes the full client charge if it includes tangible goods, but you still deduct subcontractor fees.

$

Freelancer Expenses Under $600

Even if you pay less than $600 and no 1099 is required, the expense is still deductible. Missouri follows the federal rule here too—record these payments and retain the invoice or Venmo/PayPal record.

Health Insurance (Self-Employed)

Health insurance for you and your dependents is not a Schedule C deduction but is deductible above the line. Missouri respects this deduction, which reduces your federal AGI and thus your Missouri income.

Local licenses, city permits, or fees to shoot in parks are deductible. Missouri does not require a state photography license, but local costs qualify. Keep copies of license receipts and renewal confirmations.

$

Props, Backdrops & Consumable Supplies
--------------------------------------

Deductions for supplies & consumables

Photo Props & Studio Décor

Props like furniture, themed items, fabrics, and decor for shoots are deductible. Missouri requires sales tax on these purchases—include the full amount (including tax) in your expense log.

$

Consumable Supplies (Batteries, Paper, Tape)

Items that wear out quickly—batteries, memory cards, paper rolls—are immediately deductible. Missouri follows federal de minimis rules and does not require inventory unless items are resold.

$

Client Deliverables (Prints, Albums, USBs)

Prints, frames, albums, and USB drives provided to clients are deductible. Missouri exempts these from sales tax if you present a resale certificate. Track COGS separately if you charge clients for physical goods.

Clothing that is only used for shoots—like themed costumes—is deductible. Missouri taxes the purchase but you can still deduct the total cost. Regular clothes worn to work are not deductible.

$

Financial Costs

Interest on business loans or credit cards used for photography expenses is deductible. Missouri conforms fully. Only interest (not principal) is deductible. Keep statements showing business use and interest breakdown.

$

Federal Income Tax Deduction (MO-Limited)

Missouri may allow a deduction for federal income tax paid, up to $5,000 (single) or $10,000 (married), depending on your income. This is not photography-specific but may reduce your overall Missouri tax liability.

$

Sales Tax Exemption for Resale Items

Items transferred to clients (prints, USBs, albums) can be bought tax-free with a Missouri resale certificate. Use it when buying exempt goods to avoid sales tax and track resale vs. non-resale purchases clearly.

$

Depreciation Recapture on Home Sale

If you claimed home office depreciation and sell your home, Missouri follows federal rules on recapture. Only the depreciated portion used for business gets taxed—record depreciation carefully if claiming home office.
