How to automate tax payments as a photographer
==============================================

As a [photographer](https://joinotto.com/photographers), capturing stunning moments is only part of the business. Once your passion earns money, the IRS views you as a business, shifting your role to a financial steward. While taxes may seem less appealing than photography, understanding the basics can save you from costly mistakes. We'll guide you through the essentials to handle taxes confidently so you can focus on your art.

Understanding Tax Obligations for Photographers
-----------------------------------------------

When you earn from photography, the IRS classifies you as a business, requiring you to pay taxes. This involves tracking income, expenses, and making quarterly estimated tax payments if you expect to owe more than $1,000 annually.

Importance of Estimated Tax Payments
------------------------------------

Estimated payments are necessary for self-employed individuals who owe taxes. Missing payments can result in penalties, so regularly setting aside money ensures no surprises at tax time.

How to Calculate Your Estimated Taxes
-------------------------------------

Use IRS Form 1040-ES to calculate estimated taxes based on expected income. Set aside about 30% of taxable income for taxes.

Setting Up a Tax Payment Schedule
---------------------------------

Organize payments by marking quarterly deadlines on your calendar: April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15.

Automating Your Tax Payments
----------------------------

1.   **Create an IRS Account**
    *   Visit the IRS EFTPS website and enroll with your TIN or EIN.
    *   Enter banking details for payments.
    *   Your PIN arrives by mail in 7 business days.

2.   **Activate Your EFTPS Account**
    *   Use your PIN to log in and secure your account with questions.

3.   **Schedule Your Tax Payments**
    *   Select "Make a Payment" and input your details.

4.   **Set Up Recurring Payments**
    *   Schedule future payments to align with quarterly deadlines.

5.   **Confirm and Save Your Settings**
    *   Review and submit your payment schedule, and keep a record.

6.   **Enable Notifications**
    *   Set up email reminders for upcoming payments.

Choosing the Right Payment Method
---------------------------------

You can pay online through the IRS or via check. Consider setting up direct debit for timely payments.

Utilizing Accounting Software for Automation
--------------------------------------------
