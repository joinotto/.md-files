Equipment and Gear Deductions

Maximize deductions for your essential photography equipment and digital tools.

Cameras and Lenses

North Dakota photographers can deduct cameras, lenses, and related gear through Section 179 expensing (up to $1.16 million in 2025) or depreciation via Form 4562. The state fully conforms to federal bonus depreciation rules, allowing immediate write-offs for equipment placed in service after September 27, 2017.

Lighting and Support Gear

Studio lighting, tripods, and stabilizers qualify as deductible business expenses. North Dakota’s conformity to IRC §168(k) lets photographers claim 100% bonus depreciation on these assets in the year of purchase.

Studio and Office Expenses
--------------------------

Deduct costs for your studio, home office, and utilities.

Rent and Utilities

Deduct 100% of studio rent, utilities, and insurance premiums if the space is used exclusively for business. Mixed-use spaces require proportional allocation based on square footage.

Simplified Deduction Method

Photographers using part of their home for business can claim $5 per square foot (up to 300 sq ft) via IRS Form 8829. North Dakota follows federal rules, requiring no additional state forms.

Travel and Transportation
