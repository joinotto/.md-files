Navigating [income reporting](https://joinotto.com/reporting) is daunting for creators, especially in distinguishing hobby from business income. When personal projects become profitable, understanding tax implications is crucial. Whether selling prints online or refining your niche as an influencer, knowing when your activities move from hobby to business is essential for compliance and financial benefits. Let's explore hobby vs. business income to aid informed decisions in your creative pursuits.

1. Hobby Income vs. Business Income
-----------------------------------

Hobby income comes from activities for enjoyment without profit as a main goal, while business income aims for profit. Recognizing this difference is vital for tax purposes. If your pursuit is a hobby, many [business tax deductions](https://joinotto.com/tax/business-income-deductions) may not apply.

2. When Is a Hobby a Business?
------------------------------

A hobby becomes a business with a profit motive, involving consistent profit efforts, full records, and businesslike operations. The IRS evaluates factors like profitability and intent.

3. Tax Reporting for Hobby Photographers
----------------------------------------

Hobby photographers report income as "Other Income" on Form 1040, Schedule 1. Post-2017 reforms mean hobbyists can't deduct expenses exceeding hobby income. Accurate income tracking is essential.

4. Income Thresholds and Tax Implications
-----------------------------------------

Hobbyists must report income over $400. Hobby income is taxed as regular income without self-employment tax, unlike business owners who pay both.

5. Hobby Expenses Deduction
---------------------------

Hobby photographers can't deduct expenses like businesses. Before 2018, they could deduct up to hobby income, but now expenses can't exceed income, necessitating careful spending limits.

6. Keeping Accurate Records
---------------------------

Accurate record-keeping is key for all photographers. Documenting income and expenses helps verify your activity's legitimacy, especially with IRS inquiries.

7. IRS's Profit Motive Test
---------------------------

The IRS differentiates hobbies from businesses via a profit motive test, requiring a businesslike operation and intent for profit. A business should profit in 3 of the last 5 years to pass this test.
