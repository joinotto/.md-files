*   **Identifying Your Target Audience**

Before starting your business, it’s essential to pinpoint your target audience:

Young families: Parents with young children often look for photographers who specialize in capturing candid, playful moments.

Expecting parents: Those expecting a baby may want maternity and newborn shoots.

Multigenerational families: Larger families that wish to document their lineage over the years.

3.   Invest in Quality Equipment

While starting with basic gear is possible, consider investing in:

Camera and lenses: A DSLR or mirrorless camera is ideal. A versatile zoom lens and a prime portrait lens will serve you well.

Lighting: Natural light is fantastic, but having speedlights or softboxes can enhance your indoor sessions.
