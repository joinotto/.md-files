Invoice Generator FAQs
----------------------

A valid UK invoice must include: your business name and address, your customer's name and address, a unique invoice number, invoice date, description of goods or services, VAT amount (if VAT registered), total amount payable, and payment terms. If you're VAT registered, you must also include your VAT registration number.

Absolutely. Our invoice generator is perfect for UK limited companies, sole traders, and freelancers. You can add your company registration number, VAT number, and all other details required for business invoicing in the United Kingdom.
