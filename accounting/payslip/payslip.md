----------------------

A payslip is a document provided by an employer that details a creative professional's earnings for a specific pay period. It usually includes a breakdown of [gross income](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/gross-income), deductions (like taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions), and the [net amount](https://joinotto.com/accounting/net-operating-income) the creative professional receives. Payslips can be issued in paper format or electronically, depending on the payroll system used by the employer.
