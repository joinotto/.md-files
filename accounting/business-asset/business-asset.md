**What Is a Business Asset?‍**
------------------------------

A business asset refers to anything of value that a creative professional or business owns, which can contribute to generating income or increasing the overall value of the business. It can be physical or intangible and is often recorded on a balance sheet to assess the financial health of a business. creative professionals like podcasters, visual artists, video editors, photographers, and designers will typically have assets in the form of equipment, intellectual property, or even software tools they rely on for their work.

**Classification of Business Assets**Business assets can be classified into two main categories: current assets and non-current assets.

*   [Current assets](https://joinotto.com/accounting/current-assets) are assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within a year. For creative professionals, this might include accounts receivable from clients or cash in the bank.
*   **Non-current assets** are assets that have a long-term use in the business. Examples of non-current business assets for creative professionals could include expensive cameras, studio equipment, software licenses, or intellectual property rights.

Understanding the classification of your business assets helps you manage your finances and plan for growth.

**Working Process of Business Assets**‍

The process of managing business assets involves identifying, purchasing, maintaining, and sometimes selling or upgrading them. For example, a photographer may purchase new camera equipment, track its depreciation, and ensure it is being used for income-generating projects. As business assets are used in daily operations, they may be depreciated over time (except for certain [intangible assets](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/intangible-asset), such as copyrights or trademarks, which may not depreciate in the same way).

**Valuation of Business Assets**‍

Valuation is key to understanding the worth of your business assets. When it comes to [tangible assets](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/tangible-asset), such as a filmmaker’s camera or a musician’s sound equipment, the valuation may involve estimating the current market price or considering depreciation. For intangible assets, such as the intellectual property a creative professional may own, valuation can be based on factors like licensing agreements or the projected earnings from that asset. Regularly assessing the value of business assets helps in making informed decisions about growth, sales, or investment in new assets.

**Importance of Business Assets**‍

Understanding what business assets are and their value is crucial for creative professionals looking to scale their operations. Whether it’s a new piece of software for editing videos, or studio space for recording, business assets directly impact the way a creative professional works and how they generate income. Business assets also provide collateral for financing opportunities or loans, should a creative professional need capital to expand their work.

**Uses of Business Assets**‍

Business assets are essential in performing day-to-day tasks as well as growing a creative professional’s brand. For instance, a visual artist might use an easel and canvas as business assets to create artwork, while a podcaster might depend on microphones, editing software, and their intellectual property (like podcast episodes) to attract listeners and generate revenue. Whether physical or intangible, business assets directly support your operations and long-term success.

**Interesting Facts about Business Assets**

*   Business assets examples can include not just physical equipment but also digital assets, such as website domains, client lists, or social media accounts that contribute to your overall business value.

However, this also allows you to potentially [write off](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/write-off) certain expenses on your taxes, such as travel or [reimbursable expenses](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/reimbursable-expenses) related to asset usage.
