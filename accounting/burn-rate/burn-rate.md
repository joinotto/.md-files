Burn Rate Definition
====================

What is Burn Rate?
------------------

The **burn rate** is a term used in accounting to describe how quickly a company spends its available cash. It’s important for businesses, especially startups, to know their burn rate because it helps them understand how long they can continue operating before they need to make more money or cut costs. Imagine you have a piggy bank with some money saved up. If you take money out every week to buy snacks, your burn rate shows how fast you’re using that money.

### Why is Burn Rate Important?

Knowing your burn rate is crucial for several reasons:

*   **Financial Planning:** Helps businesses [plan for future funding](https://joinotto.com/accounting/long-term-liabilities) needs.
*   **Cash Flow Management:** Shows how long a company can stay afloat without additional income.
*   **Investor Confidence:** Investors want to know that you can manage your money wisely.

### How is Burn Rate Calculated?

To calculate your burn rate, you can use this simple formula:

Burn Rate = (Starting Cash – Ending Cash) / Time Period

For example, if your business started the month with $10,000 and ended it with $7,000, your burn rate would be:

Burn Rate = ($10,000 - $7,000) / 1 Month = $3,000

This means your business is spending $3,000 each month. Understanding your burn rate helps you make smart decisions about your finances.

### What Are the Types of Burn Rate?

There are two types of burn rates you should know:

*   **Gross Burn Rate:** This includes all operating expenses, like salaries and rent, showing how much cash is going out.
*   **Net Burn Rate:** This takes into account any [net operating income](https://joinotto.com/accounting/net-operating-income) coming in, giving a clearer picture of [cash flow](https://joinotto.com/accounting/cash-book).

By keeping track of your burn rate, you can ensure that your business remains financially healthy and can plan for the future effectively.
