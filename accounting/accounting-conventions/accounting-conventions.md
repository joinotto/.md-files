Accounting Conventions: A Guide for Creators
--------------------------------------------

Accounting conventions are essential guidelines that creators like podcasters, visual artists, and others can rely on to maintain consistency in financial reporting. These conventions are widely accepted practices that complement accounting principles, ensuring that financial information is recorded and presented uniformly across various creative industries.

‍

For creators managing their own finances, understanding accounting conventions is crucial. They provide a reliable framework for tracking income, expenses, and taxes, enabling accurate financial statements that are easily understood by accountants, investors, and other stakeholders.

The Purpose of Accounting Conventions for Creators
--------------------------------------------------

Whether you're a filmmaker tracking [production costs](https://joinotto.com/accounting/production-costs) or a photographer recording revenue from photo shoots, applying accounting conventions helps you stay organized. By adhering to these conventions, creators can compare their financial performance across periods and make well-informed decisions about future projects. Commonly used conventions include the conservatism convention, which ensures that financial results reflect potential risks, and the consistency convention, which requires creators to apply the same accounting methods year after year. Establishing clear [accounting policies](https://joinotto.com/accounting/accounting-policies) ensures these conventions are consistently applied.

‍

For instance, if a podcaster adopts the [modified cash basis](https://joinotto.com/accounting/modified-cash-basis) method of accounting in the first year, sticking with that approach helps maintain consistency in financial reporting. This makes it easier to review past performances and assess how certain decisions, like upgrading equipment, have impacted the bottom line. Accounting conventions provide the discipline needed to ensure all financial decisions, whether large or small, follow a coherent system.

Examples of Accounting Conventions in Action
--------------------------------------------

1.   **Podcasters:** The consistency convention is particularly helpful. For example, if you decide to expense new recording equipment over several years (depreciation), you should continue to use the same method each year to ensure comparability of your financial statements.
2.   **Visual Artists and Designers:** The matching convention ensures that income and expenses are recognized in the same period. If a designer incurs expenses for creating artwork in December but gets paid in January, those costs should be matched with the [revenue](https://joinotto.com/accounting/revenue) in the appropriate period.

For creators, tracking income and expenses over time can be challenging without a clear set of practices. Accounting conventions, such as the going concern convention, ensure that creators assume their business will continue operating for the foreseeable future, enabling them to plan for long-term growth and sustainability.

Key Accounting Concepts and Conventions
---------------------------------------

For creators, accounting conventions work in tandem with accounting concepts and conventions to provide a structured way to manage finances. Concepts like [accrual accounting](https://joinotto.com/accounting/modified-accrual-accounting), which records income and expenses when they occur rather than when cash changes hands, align with conventions like the materiality convention, which emphasizes recording transactions that are significant to financial reporting, such as acquiring a new [asset](https://joinotto.com/accounting/asset).

‍

These conventions allow creators to filter out the noise, ensuring that minor transactions, such as purchasing a new sketchpad for a visual artist, don't clutter up the financial statements. Understanding what accounting conventions are means knowing when to focus on material items, such as new camera equipment for a photographer, rather than on every small purchase.

‍

Additionally, accounting conventions can help creators better prepare for potential audits or future financial assessments. By following the full disclosure convention, filmmakers, musicians, and others ensure that all relevant financial information, such as ongoing contractual obligations or deferred income, is clearly presented, avoiding misunderstandings or discrepancies in the long run.

The Impact of Conventions of Accounting on Creative Projects
------------------------------------------------------------

For creators, adherence to conventions of accounting also promotes financial transparency, which is essential when collaborating with sponsors, investors, or co-creators. Whether you're producing a podcast series funded by advertisers or working with a gallery to showcase your artwork, applying consistent accounting methods makes it easier to demonstrate profitability, track payments, and ensure that partners are well-informed of the project’s financial standing. You may find it helpful to use a [job cost sheet](https://joinotto.com/accounting/job-cost-sheet) to track project-specific expenses and revenues.

‍

Consider the objectivity convention, which requires that all recorded transactions be based on objective, verifiable evidence. This can be particularly important when contracts, like an [engagement letter](https://joinotto.com/accounting/engagement-letter), outline project terms and payment. By applying this convention, creators can safeguard themselves from potential disputes and ensure that all financial records are backed by clear documentation.
