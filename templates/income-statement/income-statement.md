What is an income statement?
----------------------------

An income statement shows your company’s income versus expenses to calculate profit. It's sometimes called a profit and loss statement (P&L), statement of operations, or statement of earnings. Income statements can be generated to track performance over a month, quarter, or year. They’re useful for reviewing cash flow and forecasting future business outcomes. Smart business owners review income statements along with other key documents, like the balance sheet and cash flow statement, to monitor and improve business health.

Income statement format.
------------------------

An income statement shows a company's financial performance over a specific period. It starts with revenue, which includes money earned from selling goods or services. Expenses follow, covering costs like inventory, rent, and supplies. The profit or loss is determined by subtracting expenses from revenue. If expenses are lower than revenue, there’s a profit; if higher, there’s a loss. This statement provides a clear picture of business profitability.

Income statement formula.
-------------------------

The income statement formula calculates a company's profitability by subtracting total expenses from total revenue. It is structured as: Revenue - Expenses = Profit/Loss. Revenue refers to income earned from sales or services, while expenses include all costs incurred in running the business, such as operating expenses, materials, and overheads. A positive result shows a profit, while a negative result indicates a loss, helping businesses track financial performance over time.
