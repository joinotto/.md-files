FAQs
----

### Why do photographers need a contract?



A contract protects photographers by defining service details, payment terms, cancellation policies, and copyright ownership. It helps prevent misunderstandings, ensures legal protection, and sets clear expectations between the photographer and the client.

### What should a photography contract include?



A photography contract should cover client details, service scope, pricing, payment terms, cancellation policy, usage rights, copyright ownership, model release (if applicable), and liability limits. It ensures clarity on expectations and responsibilities.

### Who owns the rights to the photos in a photography contract?



By default, photographers retain copyright unless stated otherwise. A contract should specify whether the client receives a license to use the images, restrictions on modifications, and any exclusivity terms.

### Can a client request edits after signing the contract?



Yes, but the contract should outline revision limits, additional fees for extra edits, and the timeframe for requested changes. Clear terms prevent disputes and set expectations for post-production services.

### What happens if a photographer cancels the contract?



The contract should include a cancellation clause explaining refund policies, rescheduling options, and potential liabilities. Many contracts allow for alternative photographers or full refunds if cancellations are due to unavoidable circumstances.
