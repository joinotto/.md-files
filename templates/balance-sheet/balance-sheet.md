Balance sheet format.
---------------------

A balance sheet format is a financial statement that shows a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It consists of three main sections: assets, liabilities, and equity. Assets are what the company owns, liabilities are what it owes, and equity represents the owner’s interest in the business. The balance sheet follows the equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity, ensuring that the company's resources and obligations are accurately represented.
