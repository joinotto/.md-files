What is a business proposal?
----------------------------

A business proposal is a document used to convince a client or organization to purchase a product or service. It may be solicited, meaning the company is actively seeking proposals, or unsolicited, where you’re proposing a solution the company hasn’t yet considered. Your proposal should clearly demonstrate how you can address the client’s needs, outlining goals, timelines, deliverables, and budget to help them evaluate your offer.
