What is a purchase order form?
------------------------------

A purchase order (PO) is a document used when buying goods or services from a seller. It outlines the product or service, quantity, price, delivery date, and payment terms. As the buyer, you create the PO with any special requests, and the seller can accept it by signing the order. Once signed, the PO becomes a legally binding agreement. The unique PO number helps track the order and is often included on the seller's invoice.
