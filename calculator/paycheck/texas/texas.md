Use Otto AI Texas paycheck calculator to accurately estimate your take-home pay after federal taxes and deductions. Texas has no state income tax, which can help you keep more of your paycheck compared to many other states. Our tool is perfect for employees, freelancers, and small business owners in Texas who want a clear picture of their net pay.

Otto AI interactive map highlights the most paycheck friendly counties across the U.S. Zoom between states and the national map to see specific data points for each region, or toggle between the four ranking criteria in our analysis to visualize how each factor impacts the rankings, including Semi-Monthly Paycheck, Purchasing Power, Unemployment Rate, and Income Growth.

### How Your Texas Paycheck Works

While Texas doesn't have a state income tax, federal tax withholdings and other deductions still reduce your take-home pay. Your job may pay you an hourly wage or a salary, but your net pay will reflect what's left after federal obligations and any deductions for benefits or retirement.

Key paycheck deductions in Texas include:

*   Federal Income Tax: Calculated using IRS tax brackets and your W-4 selections.
*   FICA Taxes: 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare, plus an extra 0.9% Medicare surtax for high earners making over $200,000 individually or $250,000 jointly.
*   Pre-Tax Deductions: Health insurance, 401(k), HSA, or other benefit contributions.

Employers match your Social Security and Medicare contributions. If you're self-employed, you pay both shares yourself—equaling a 15.3% self-employment tax, which our texas take home pay calculator accounts for automatically.

This means average monthly gross pay above $6,200 in 2023, but your actual net pay depends on your federal tax bracket and other deductions. Use Otto AI paycheck calculator texas to see exactly how much you'll take home.

### Texas Paycheck Tax Calculator

Our Texas paycheck tax calculator considers:

*   Filing status (single, married, head of household)
*   Pay frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly)
*   Pre-tax deductions like 401(k) or HSA contributions
*   Additional federal withholdings you specify

Since Texas has no state income tax, your main tax responsibilities come from federal income tax and FICA, which our Texas tax calculator estimates accurately.

### How Much Taxes Are Deducted from Paycheck Texas?

Wondering how much taxes are deducted from paycheck Texas? While Texas doesn’t tax income at the state level, your paycheck will still have these standard federal deductions:

*   Federal Income Tax
*   Social Security (6.2% of wages)
*   Medicare (1.45% of wages; plus 0.9% Medicare surtax for high earners)

Use our Texas take home pay calculator to get a precise estimate of your net income.

### How You Can Affect Your Texas Paycheck

Although some paycheck deductions are mandatory, you can adjust certain factors to control your take-home pay:

*   Retirement Contributions: Increasing 401(k) or IRA savings reduces taxable income, lowering your take-home pay now while helping you save for retirement.
*   Health Benefits: Choosing different insurance plans or adding dependents can change your deductions and your net pay.
*   W-4 Updates: Changing your W-4 lets you adjust how much federal tax is withheld from your paycheck, impacting your paycheck size and tax refund.

Use Otto AI take home pay calculator texas to see how changes to your withholdings or deductions will affect your paycheck.

### Smart Strategies for Texas Employees

*   Choose the right withholding on your W-4
