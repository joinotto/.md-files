### Understanding Your Virginia Paycheck

Each time you're paid, your employer deducts a portion of your earnings for federal, state, and sometimes local taxes, along with other voluntary or mandatory withholdings. The amount left over is your take-home pay.

*   **Federal Income Tax**

Your federal tax liability is determined by: Earnings, Filing status, W-4 details (allowances, dependents, and additional withholdings). Federal tax rates are progressive, ranging from 10% to 37%. The higher your income, the larger the percentage deducted.
*   **Virginia State Income Tax**

Virginia’s income tax is also progressive, with four tax brackets: 2% on the first $3,000; 3% on $3,001 to $5,000; 5% on $5,001 to $17,000; 5.75% on income over $17,000. Your income and filing status determine how much state tax is withheld. Otto AI Virginia tax calculator automatically applies the correct bracket for accurate results.
*   **FICA Taxes**

FICA includes: Social Security: 6.2% on income up to $168,600 (2025); Medicare: 1.45% on all earnings; Additional Medicare: 0.9% on wages above $200,000. These contributions fund your future benefits and are automatically deducted from every paycheck.
*   **Pre-Tax Deductions and Benefits**

Your paycheck may also be reduced by: 401(k) or retirement plan contributions, Health, dental, or vision insurance premiums, Health Savings Accounts (HSA) or Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA). These pre-tax deductions lower your taxable income, meaning you pay less in both federal and state taxes.
