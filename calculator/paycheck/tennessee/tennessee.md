*   **Federal Income Tax**

The biggest deduction from your paycheck will likely be federal income tax. Your total withholding is based on: Your gross wages, Filing status (e.g., single, married), W-4 information such as allowances and dependents. The federal tax rate ranges from 10% to 37% depending on your income level.
*   **FICA Taxes**

These are mandatory contributions to Social Security and Medicare, which are standard across the U.S. Social Security: 6.2% of wages up to the wage cap; Medicare: 1.45% of all wages; Additional Medicare Tax: 0.9% if you earn more than $200,000 annually.
