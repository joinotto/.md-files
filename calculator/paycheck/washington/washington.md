### What’s Included in Your Paycheck Calculation?

Although Washington doesn't charge state income tax, there are still various deductions you need to consider when estimating your net income. Otto AI WA paycheck calculator breaks these down in detail.

*   **Federal Income Tax**

The federal government taxes your income using a progressive rate system with brackets ranging from 10% to 37%. Your rate depends on your annual earnings, your filing status (e.g., single, married), and allowances or additional withholdings on your W-4.
*   **FICA Taxes**

FICA includes two major contributions: Social Security: 6.2% of wages up to $168,600 (2025 limit); Medicare: 1.45% on all wages, plus 0.9% extra if you earn over $200,000. These are automatically deducted from your paycheck and are matched by your employer.
*   **Pre-Tax Deductions**

Pre-tax deductions are taken out before your income is taxed, reducing your overall taxable earnings. Common examples include: 401(k) or retirement contributions, health insurance premiums, Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) or Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). These deductions help maximize your take-home pay by minimizing your tax burden.

### Washington’s Tax Landscape

Washington is known for being income-tax free, which makes it attractive to workers and employers alike. However, residents still face:

*   Federal taxes on income
*   FICA payroll taxes
*   Sales and business taxes at the state level (though not deducted from paychecks)

This tax setup often results in higher take-home pay compared to states with high income tax rates.

*   ✔️ Full-time salaried employees
*   ✔️ Hourly wage earners
*   ✔️ Freelancers and independent contractors
