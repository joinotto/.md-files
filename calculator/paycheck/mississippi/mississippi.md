### How Your Mississippi Paycheck Works

Your paycheck starts with your gross earnings—your salary or hourly wage multiplied by hours worked. Mississippi’s income tax system has a progressive structure with rates up to 5%, so the more you earn, the higher your effective state tax rate. Federal income tax, FICA taxes, and voluntary pre-tax deductions like retirement or health insurance also reduce your net pay.

Key paycheck deductions in Mississippi include:

*   Federal Income Tax: Calculated using IRS tax brackets and your W-4 elections.
*   Mississippi State Income Tax: Progressive rates up to 5% on taxable income.
*   FICA Taxes: 6.2% Social Security tax and 1.45% Medicare tax, plus an additional 0.9% Medicare surtax for individuals earning over $200,000 or joint filers over $250,000.
*   Other Pre-Tax Deductions: Such as 401(k) contributions, HSA deposits, or employer-sponsored health insurance.

Employers match your Social Security and Medicare contributions. If you’re self-employed, you’re responsible for both the employee and employer shares—a combined 15.3% self-employment tax, which our MS paycheck calculator includes automatically.
