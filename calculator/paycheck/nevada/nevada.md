### How Nevada’s Tax Structure Affects Your Paycheck

Unlike many other states, Nevada does not impose a state income tax, which is great news for residents. This means more of your paycheck stays with you. However, you still need to account for:

*   **Federal Income Tax:** This is based on your income bracket and filing status.
*   **FICA Taxes:** Includes Social Security (6.2%) and Medicare (1.45%). If your earnings exceed $200,000, an additional 0.9% Medicare tax applies.
*   **Pre-tax Deductions:** Retirement contributions (like 401(k)), health insurance premiums, HSA/FSA contributions, and other voluntary deductions reduce your taxable income.
*   **No State Income Tax:** Since Nevada doesn’t tax personal income, your take-home pay is higher compared to states with income tax.

Otto AI Nevada tax calculator simplifies the process by automatically applying the most current tax rates and rules so you can focus on what matters—planning your finances with clarity.
