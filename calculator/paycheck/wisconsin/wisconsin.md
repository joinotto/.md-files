### Understanding Your Wisconsin Paycheck: What Gets Deducted

Even though Wisconsin has relatively moderate tax rates, paycheck deductions can still take a chunk out of your gross income. Our paycheck calculator Wisconsin covers all the key components that affect your net pay:

*   **Federal Income Tax**

Federal tax is based on progressive tax brackets that range from 10% to 37%. Your final amount withheld depends on your filing status, income, and withholding elections (like dependents or extra withholdings on your W-4).
*   **FICA Taxes (Social Security & Medicare)**

Social Security: 6.2% on income up to $168,600 (2025 cap). Medicare: 1.45% on all wages, plus an additional 0.9% on income over $200,000. These are standard payroll taxes that apply across all states and are shared by employees and employers.
*   **Wisconsin State Income Tax**

Wisconsin has a progressive income tax structure with four brackets: 3.5%, 4.4%, 5.3%, and 7.65% based on income and filing status. The more you earn, the higher the percentage applied to your income. Use Otto AI Wisconsin income tax calculator to automatically calculate how much will be withheld based on your current earnings.
*   **Pre-Tax Benefits**

Contributions to 401(k)s, HSAs, FSAs, or health insurance premiums reduce your taxable income. These deductions lower your federal and state income tax bills and increase your take-home pay.

### Wisconsin Tax Structure: What You Need to Know

Unlike states with flat income tax rates, Wisconsin uses a tiered system that affects how much you take home. Even if you don't earn a six-figure salary, your filing status, taxable benefits, and pre-tax deductions can significantly impact your paycheck.

*   No local or city income tax in Wisconsin
*   Federal taxes calculated using IRS rules
*   Consistent FICA deductions for Social Security and Medicare

Use our paycheck calculator WI to see how these elements come together in real numbers.
