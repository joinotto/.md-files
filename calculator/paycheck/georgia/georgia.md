### How Your Georgia Paycheck Works

Your paycheck starts with your gross earnings—your salary or hourly wage multiplied by your hours worked. But your actual take-home pay is reduced by federal income tax, state income tax, FICA taxes, and any pre-tax deductions like health insurance or retirement contributions. Georgia’s state income tax is progressive, so the more you earn, the higher the percentage of state tax you’ll pay.

Key deductions include:

*   Federal Income Tax: Based on your W-4 elections and IRS tax brackets.
*   Georgia State Income Tax: Ranges from 1% to 5.75% depending on taxable income.
*   FICA Taxes: 6.2% Social Security tax and 1.45% Medicare tax, plus an additional 0.9% Medicare surtax for individuals earning over $200,000 or joint filers over $250,000.
*   Pre-Tax Deductions: Such as 401(k), HSA, or employer-sponsored health insurance.

Employers match Social Security and Medicare contributions. If you’re self-employed, you pay both the employer and employee portions—a combined 15.3% self-employment tax, which our ga paycheck calculator accounts for automatically.

That means many Georgians earn an average monthly gross income over $6,000 in 2023. But your net pay will be lower once taxes and deductions are withheld. Use Otto AI take home pay calculator georgia to see exactly how much will my paycheck be.
