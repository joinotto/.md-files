IRR Calculator FAQs
-------------------

### What is an IRR calculator?



An IRR calculator helps you estimate the internal rate of return on an investment based on initial cost and a series of expected cash flows. It shows the annualized rate at which your investment breaks even in terms of net present value (NPV).

### How do I calculate IRR using this tool?



Simply input your initial investment amount (as a negative value) followed by a series of cash flows for each period. The calculator then determines the internal rate of return that sets your NPV to zero.

### What types of investments is the IRR calculator good for?



Otto AI IRR calculator is perfect for evaluating real estate projects, startup funding, business investments, or any financial scenario with periodic returns or uneven cash flows.

### What’s the difference between IRR and ROI?



IRR measures the annualized return on an investment, factoring in the time value of money, while ROI simply shows the total return percentage without accounting for time.

### Can I enter irregular or uneven cash flows?



Yes. Otto AI IRR cash flow calculator supports both even and uneven cash flows across multiple periods, making it ideal for real-world investments that don’t produce consistent returns.

### Is this internal rate of return calculator accurate for non-annual periods?



Yes. You can use monthly, quarterly, or annual cash flows. Just be consistent with the period spacing for all inputs. The calculator will return the periodic IRR, which you can annualize if needed.

### Can this tool calculate negative IRR or multiple IRRs?



If your cash flow pattern results in more than one IRR or no real solution, the calculator may not return a result. This is a known limitation of IRR math, not the calculator itself. You may want to consider using an NPV approach in those cases.

### Is Otto AI IRR calculator free and private?



Absolutely. Otto AI IRR calculator is 100% free to use, requires no login, and doesn’t store your data. It’s designed for fast, secure, and reliable financial planning.
