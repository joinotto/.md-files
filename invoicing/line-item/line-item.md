What is a Line Item?
--------------------

A line item refers to a single entry in an invoice that details a product or service provided. Each line item includes information such as the description of the item, the quantity, the [unit price](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/unit-of-measure), and the total cost for that specific item. This helps both the seller and the buyer keep track of what was purchased and how much is owed.

Why are Line Items Important?
-----------------------------

Line items are important because they provide clarity on what is being charged. Instead of receiving a vague total amount, customers can see exactly what they are paying for. This is especially useful for creators and small businesses when:

*   They need to itemize their services for clients.

On an invoice, line items are usually listed in a table format. Here’s a simple example:

*   Description: Graphic Design Services
*   Quantity: 1
*   Unit Price: $100
*   Total: $100

This structure helps customers easily see the details of each charge, making the invoice more transparent. For more complex invoices, you might include taxes, [partial payments](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/partial-payment), or [net terms](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/net-terms).

As a creator, you may want to consider:

*   Customizing line items to reflect your unique services or products.
