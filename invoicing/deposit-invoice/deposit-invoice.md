Deposit Invoice
===============

What is a Deposit Invoice?
--------------------------

A Deposit Invoice is a type of invoice that is issued when a business requires a [partial payment](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/partial-payment) upfront before starting work on a project or delivering goods. This is common in many industries, especially in construction, events planning, and creative services. It helps ensure that the service provider has some financial security before committing their time and resources.

Why are Deposit Invoices used?
------------------------------

Deposit Invoices are important for several reasons:

*   They provide a level of security for the business, ensuring that they receive some payment before starting a project.
*   They can help cover initial costs associated with the project, such as materials or labor.
*   They set clear expectations with the client regarding [payment schedules](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/payment-terms), leading to better financial planning.

How do you calculate a Deposit Invoice?
---------------------------------------

Calculating a Deposit Invoice is straightforward. Here’s a simple formula to follow:

Deposit Amount = Total Project Cost x Deposit Percentage

For example, if the total project cost is $2,000 and the deposit percentage is 30%, the calculation would be:

Deposit Amount = $2,000 x 0.30 = $600

What should be included in a Deposit Invoice?
---------------------------------------------

When creating a Deposit Invoice, it’s important to include the following details:

*   [Invoice Number](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/invoice-number): A unique identifier for tracking purposes.
*   Date of Issue: When the invoice is created.
*   Client Information: Name and contact details of the client.
*   Description of Services: What the deposit is for, detailing the project.
*   Total Project Cost: The full amount due for the project.
*   Deposit Amount: The amount the client needs to pay upfront.
*   [Payment Terms](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/payment-terms): How and when the deposit should be paid.

Who typically uses Deposit Invoices?

Deposit Invoices are commonly used by:

*   **Freelancers:**Such as graphic designers, writers, and photographers who require [advance payments](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/advance-payment).
