What is VAT (Value Added Tax)?
------------------------------

VAT, or Value Added Tax, is a type of indirect tax that is imposed on goods and services at each stage of production or distribution. It is widely used in many countries around the world. Essentially, VAT is charged on the value added to a product at each step of its journey from production to sale.

How does VAT work?
------------------

When a business sells a product, it adds VAT to the selling price. For example, if a creator sells a handmade item for $100 and the VAT rate is 10%, the total cost to the buyer would be $110. The business collects this extra $10 and later pays it to the government. This is how the tax is applied:

*   **Production Stage:** A manufacturer creates a product and sells it for $50 plus $5 VAT (total $55). The manufacturer issues a [tax invoice](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/tax-invoice) to document the transaction.
*   **Wholesale Stage:** A wholesaler buys it for $55 and sells it for $80 plus $8 VAT (total $88). The wholesaler can deduct the $5 VAT already paid, so they pay $3 to the government.
*   **Retail Stage:**A retailer sells the product for $100 plus $10 VAT (total $110). They deduct the $8 VAT paid and send $2 to the government.

What are some common VAT rates around the world?
------------------------------------------------

VAT rates vary across countries. Here are a few examples:

*   European Union countries typically have VAT rates ranging from 17% to 27%.
*   In Canada, GST (Goods and Services Tax) is 5%, but provinces may add their own sales taxes.
*   In the United States, there is no federal VAT, but sales taxes vary by state.

How can creators manage VAT effectively?
