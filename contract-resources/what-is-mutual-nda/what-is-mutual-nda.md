A [Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)](https://joinotto.com/contract/mutual-nda) is a legal contract where two parties agree to keep each other's confidential information secret. This is especially important for creatives like photographers, designers, or filmmakers who often share sensitive ideas or projects with others. For instance, if two artists are collaborating on a project, a Mutual NDA ensures that neither will share the other's creative concepts with outsiders.

*   **Build Trust:** Using an NDA can help establish a sense of trust and professionalism between parties. It shows you take confidentiality seriously.
