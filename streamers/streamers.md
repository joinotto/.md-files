Otto AI is modernising Finance

Your Finances, Under Control.
-----------------------------

Smart, simple finances for streamers — focus on your stream, your subs, and your next big collab, not receipts, invoices, or the IRS breathing down your neck.

In Good Company

"Otto gets what creative businesses need—simplicity, speed, and no distractions."

Founder · Sorry Dad Co.

Entity Management

Make Your Stream a Real Business
--------------------------------

Otto AI helps you form an LLC or S-Corp so you can separate your gaming setup from your real financial life. Write off your gear, protect your income, and stop explaining to your mom why you’re “technically self-employed.”

Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping for Gear, Glitches, and Gamer Fuel
----------------------------------------------

Track your headset, mic, Stream Deck, software, TwitchCon flights, snack-fueled editing sessions, and whatever new RGB nightmare you just added to your desk. Otto AI makes it all tax-deductible and organized.

Invoicing

Invoicing for Collabs, Sponsors, and Shoutouts That Actually Pay
----------------------------------------------------------------

Otto AI lets you send professional invoices for sponsorships, branded segments, merch collabs, UGC, consulting, and voice work—without cobbling it together in Canva.

Contracts

Contracts That Keep Your Rights, Rates, and VODs Safe
-----------------------------------------------------

Otto AI includes plug-and-play contracts for streamers—covering sponsorships, content licensing, affiliate campaigns, usage rights, and deliverables. So you never get ghosted by a “gaming chair brand” again.

Tax Tools That Don’t Rage Quit
------------------------------

Otto AI automatically tracks subs, donations, ad revenue, affiliate payouts, merch, and Twitch tips. It gives you quarterly tax estimates and reminders—so tax season doesn’t turn into a total wipe.
