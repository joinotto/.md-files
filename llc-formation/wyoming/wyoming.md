How to Start an LLC in Wyoming. A Step by Step Guide
----------------------------------------------------

Wyoming is one of the most business friendly states in the country, widely known for its low taxes, strong privacy protections, and simple business regulations. Many entrepreneurs choose Wyoming for its lack of personal income tax, franchise tax, and corporate income tax. The state also provides exceptional asset protection laws, making it a popular choice for small business owners, real estate investors, holding companies, and online businesses. Whether you're operating in Cheyenne, Casper, Laramie, Gillette, Sheridan, or running a remote business, forming a Wyoming LLC offers stability, flexibility, and long term legal protection.

Wyoming’s business formation process is straightforward, fast, and almost entirely digital. With low filing fees, minimal annual requirements, and strong legal protections, Wyoming has become a top state for entrepreneurs seeking a simple and affordable LLC structure. This guide explains all the steps required to form your Wyoming LLC, including naming rules, tax obligations, licensing, and compliance.

Steps to Start an LLC in Wyoming
--------------------------------

### Step 1. Choose a Name for Your Wyoming LLC

Your LLC name must be unique and distinguishable from all other registered businesses in Wyoming. You can use the Wyoming Business Entity Search tool to check availability. If you'd like to reserve your name before forming your LLC, you can file an Application for Reservation of Name for $60, which holds the name for 120 days.

Your business name must include “LLC,” “L.L.C.,” or “Limited Liability Company.” Restricted words such as bank, trust, attorney, engineer, or insurance require proper licensing or state approval. Your name must not imply affiliation with government agencies or mislead consumers. Choose a name that fits your brand and is optimized for marketing and digital visibility.

### Step 2. Appoint a Registered Agent

Wyoming requires every LLC to designate a Registered Agent. This agent receives legal documents, compliance notices, and state correspondence on behalf of your business. The agent must have a physical street address in Wyoming and be available during normal business hours. You may act as your own Registered Agent or hire a commercial Registered Agent service. The LLC itself cannot act as its own agent.

### Step 3. File the Articles of Organization

Your Wyoming LLC becomes official when you file the Articles of Organization with the Wyoming Secretary of State. The filing fee is $100 if submitted online and $102 if filed by mail. Required information includes your LLC name, Registered Agent details, principal office address, and management structure. Wyoming does not require you to list member names in the public filing, offering an added layer of privacy. Online filings are typically processed within a few business days, giving you a quick path to formation.

### Step 4. Draft an Operating Agreement

Although Wyoming does not require an Operating Agreement, preparing one is highly recommended. This internal document outlines ownership percentages, roles, voting rights, profit distribution rules, and procedures for resolving disputes. Without an Operating Agreement, your LLC defaults to Wyoming’s statutory rules. A clear and comprehensive agreement reduces conflict and ensures your business runs smoothly.

### Step 5. Obtain an EIN

Your Employer Identification Number. EIN. is a federal tax ID issued by the IRS. It is required to open business bank accounts, hire employees, file federal taxes, and obtain certain permits. Single member LLCs may also need an EIN depending on tax elections or banking requirements. You can apply for an EIN for free through the IRS website.

### Step 6. Register for Wyoming State Taxes

Wyoming is a tax friendly state with no personal or corporate income tax. however, depending on your business activities, your LLC may need to register for other state level taxes. If you sell taxable goods or services, you must register for sales and use tax through the Wyoming Department of Revenue. Employers must register for unemployment insurance tax. Certain industries—such as lodging, mining, or fuel—require additional permits or tax accounts.

### Step 7. Obtain Required Business Licenses and Local Permits

Wyoming does not require a statewide general business license. however, local cities and counties may have licensing requirements. Municipalities such as Cheyenne, Casper, Laramie, and Gillette often require business permits depending on your operations. Professional and occupational licensing is required for regulated fields including construction, health care, accounting, real estate, food service, transportation, and cosmetology.

### Step 8. File the Wyoming Annual Report

Wyoming LLCs must file an Annual Report each year by the first day of the anniversary month of formation. The fee is a minimum of $60, based on the value of business assets located within Wyoming. The Annual Report keeps your business information current with the state. Failing to file on time may result in penalties or administrative dissolution.
