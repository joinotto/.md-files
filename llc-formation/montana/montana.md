How to Start an LLC in Montana. A Step by Step Guide
----------------------------------------------------

Montana is known for its low cost of doing business, natural resource based industries, thriving tourism economy, and strong support for small business growth. Entrepreneurs benefit from affordable filing fees, low regulatory burdens, and a diverse economic landscape that includes agriculture, manufacturing, outdoor recreation, technology, retail, transportation, mining, and hospitality. Whether you're launching a small venture in Missoula, opening a shop in Bozeman, or expanding into Billings or Helena, forming a Montana LLC helps protect your personal assets while giving your business legal credibility and operational flexibility.

The Montana Secretary of State has created a seamless online filing environment where nearly all business registrations and renewals can be completed electronically. The state’s maintenance requirements are simple, and fees are lower than many other states. This guide outlines each essential step to help you create your Montana LLC confidently. from choosing a business name to meeting annual reporting obligations.

Steps to Start an LLC in Montana
--------------------------------

### Step 1. Choose a Name for Your Montana LLC

Your LLC name must be unique and distinguishable from existing businesses on record in Montana. You can check name availability using the Montana Secretary of State Business Search tool. If you want to reserve your name before filing, you may submit a Name Reservation request for $10, which holds the name for 120 days.

Your LLC name must include “LLC,” “L.L.C.,” or “Limited Liability Company.” Certain words such as bank, trust, insurance, engineer, attorney, or architect are restricted and require additional approvals or licensing. Your name must not mislead the public or imply affiliation with government agencies. When selecting a business name, consider branding, clarity, and domain name availability for your online presence.

### Step 2. Appoint a Registered Agent

Montana requires every LLC to appoint a Registered Agent. This individual or entity receives official state correspondence, legal notices, and service of process. The agent must maintain a physical street address in Montana and be available during normal business hours. You may act as your own Registered Agent, appoint someone you trust, or hire a commercial Registered Agent service. Your LLC cannot serve as its own agent. A dependable Registered Agent ensures timely receipt of important legal and compliance documents.

### Step 3. File the Articles of Organization

Your LLC is legally formed when you file the Articles of Organization with the Montana Secretary of State. The filing fee is $35. All filings must be submitted online through the state’s business services portal. The Articles require your LLC name, Registered Agent details, business address, and management structure. Most filings are processed quickly, often within one to two business days. Once approved, Montana will issue confirmation that your LLC is officially active.

### Step 4. Draft an Operating Agreement

Although Montana does not require an Operating Agreement, every LLC should have one. This internal document outlines ownership percentages, voting procedures, management duties, profit distribution rules, dispute resolution processes, and steps for adding or removing members. Without an Operating Agreement, your LLC will default to Montana’s general business statutes, which may not fully align with your intended structure. A well written Operating Agreement protects your business interests and supports internal organization.

### Step 5. Obtain an EIN

An Employer Identification Number. EIN. is your business’s federal tax ID issued by the IRS. You need an EIN to open a business bank account, hire employees, and file federal taxes. Single member LLCs may also need an EIN for tax elections or financial purposes. You can obtain an EIN for free directly from the IRS website. Most applicants receive the number immediately after completing the online form.

### Step 6. Register for Montana State Taxes

Your Montana LLC may need to register for specific state tax accounts. If your business sells taxable goods or certain services, you must register for Montana sales tax—however, Montana is one of the few states that does not impose a general statewide sales tax. Depending on your activities, you may need to register for employer withholding tax or industry specific tax accounts administered through the Montana Department of Revenue. Montana does not levy a franchise or privilege tax on standard LLCs, which keeps ongoing costs low.

### Step 7. File the Montana Annual Report

All Montana LLCs must file an Annual Report each year by April 15. The filing fee is $20 when submitted on time. Late filings increase to $35. The Annual Report updates your business’s Registered Agent information, principal office address, and management details. Failure to file may result in penalties and administrative dissolution. Filing online is simple and recommended for accuracy and speed.

### Step 8. Obtain Business Licenses and Local Permits

Montana does not require a statewide general business license. however, many cities and counties—including Billings, Missoula, Great Falls, Bozeman, Butte, and Helena—have individual licensing requirements. Your LLC may also need zoning permits, health permits, environmental approvals, or state regulated professional licenses depending on your industry. Regulated professions include construction, health care, financial services, food service, child care, real estate, and transportation. Always check with local authorities and professional licensing boards to ensure full compliance.

How Much Does It Cost to Start an LLC in Montana?
-------------------------------------------------

Here is a summary of typical formation and maintenance costs. Articles of Organization. $35. Name Reservation. optional. $10. Annual Report. $20 if filed on time. Local business permits or professional licenses. varies by city and industry. Optional Registered Agent services and expedited filings may increase total costs. Montana’s low filing fees and absence of a statewide sales tax make it one of the most affordable states in the U.S. for starting and maintaining an LLC.
