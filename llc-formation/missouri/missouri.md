How to Start an LLC in Missouri. A Step by Step Guide
-----------------------------------------------------

Missouri offers a strong central U.S. location, competitive business costs, and a diverse economy, making it an excellent place for entrepreneurs to start and grow a company. With thriving industries including manufacturing, retail, agriculture, logistics, construction, technology, biosciences, and health care, the state provides a wide range of opportunities for small and mid sized businesses. Forming a Missouri LLC grants business owners personal liability protection, flexible tax classification options, and a streamlined management structure.

Missouri is known for its business friendly regulatory environment and straightforward online filing system. The Missouri Secretary of State provides a simple digital portal that allows business owners to complete formation documents quickly. This guide offers a detailed breakdown of the steps required to form your Missouri LLC, the costs involved, and what you need to do to stay compliant with ongoing state requirements.

Steps to Start an LLC in Missouri
---------------------------------

### Step 1. Choose a Name for Your Missouri LLC

Your LLC name must be unique and distinguishable from all other businesses registered in Missouri. You can use the Missouri Secretary of State business search tool to verify name availability. If you want to reserve your desired name, you may file an Application for Reservation of Name for $25, which secures the name for 60 days.

Your LLC name must include “LLC,” “L.L.C.,” or “Limited Liability Company.” Missouri restricts the use of terms like bank, insurance, engineer, architect, attorney, or trust unless additional licensing and documentation are provided. Names cannot mislead the public or falsely imply government affiliation. Choose a name that aligns with your branding and resonates with your customers.

### Step 2. Appoint a Registered Agent

Missouri requires every LLC to designate a Registered Agent. This individual or business entity receives legal notices, compliance documents, tax forms, and service of process on behalf of your LLC. The agent must have a physical street address in Missouri and be available during regular business hours. You may serve as your own Registered Agent or hire a professional agent service. Your LLC cannot act as its own Registered Agent. Choosing a reliable agent ensures you never miss important state or legal notifications.

### Step 3. File the Articles of Organization

Your Missouri LLC is officially formed by filing the Articles of Organization with the Missouri Secretary of State. The filing fee is $50 if filed online or $105 by mail. Online filing is both faster and cheaper. The Articles require your LLC name, Registered Agent information, management structure, and business purpose. Most online filings are processed within a few business days. Once approved, the state provides confirmation that your LLC is legally active.

### Step 4. Draft an Operating Agreement

Missouri does not legally require an Operating Agreement. however, creating one is highly recommended. This internal document outlines your LLC’s ownership percentages, management responsibilities, voting rights, profit distribution rules, dispute resolution processes, and procedures for adding or removing members. Without an Operating Agreement, your LLC defaults to Missouri’s general state laws. which may not reflect how you want to run your business. A strong Operating Agreement provides clarity and supports long term operational stability.

### Step 5. Obtain an EIN

Your Employer Identification Number. EIN. is issued by the IRS and serves as your federal tax ID. You need an EIN to open business bank accounts, hire employees, and file federal taxes. Most banks require an EIN even for single member LLCs. You can obtain your EIN for free through the IRS website, and most applicants receive the number immediately after submitting their application.

### Step 6. Register for Missouri State Taxes

Your Missouri LLC may need to register for various state tax accounts depending on the type of business you operate. If you sell taxable goods or services, you must register for sales tax with the Missouri Department of Revenue. Employers must also register for withholding tax and unemployment insurance tax. Missouri does not impose a separate franchise tax on traditional LLCs. Instead, tax requirements depend on whether your LLC is taxed as a sole proprietorship, partnership, S corporation, or C corporation at the federal level.

### Step 7. File the Missouri Annual Report

Missouri does not require LLCs to file an Annual Report. This sets it apart from many states and reduces long term compliance obligations and costs. However, you must still update your Registered Agent or business address if any changes occur. Staying current with your information ensures your LLC remains in good standing.

### Step 8. Obtain Business Licenses and Local Permits

Missouri does not issue a statewide general business license. Still, many cities and counties. including St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, Columbia, Independence, and Jefferson City. require local business licenses or permits. Depending on your industry, you may also need state regulated occupational licenses, zoning approvals, health department permits, or specialty regulatory clearances. Regulated industries include construction, health care, real estate, food service, transportation, and financial services. Always verify local and state level requirements before opening your business.

How Much Does It Cost to Start an LLC in Missouri?
--------------------------------------------------

Here’s a breakdown of typical formation and compliance costs. Articles of Organization. $50 online or $105 by mail. Name Reservation. optional. $25. Local business licenses or permits. varies by city and industry. Optional Registered Agent services may add additional fees. Missouri remains one of the more affordable states for forming and operating an LLC due to low online filing fees and no annual reporting requirement.
