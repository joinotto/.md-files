How to Start an LLC in Connecticut. A Step by Step Guide
--------------------------------------------------------

Connecticut offers one of the strongest and most educated workforces in the country. This makes it an appealing place for entrepreneurs who want to build a business with long term growth potential. With close proximity to major economic hubs like New York City and Boston, Connecticut provides access to a wide range of markets while maintaining a high quality of life. Forming a Connecticut LLC gives business owners liability protection, tax advantages, and flexibility in management. This makes it a preferred structure for small business owners, professionals, and startups across the state.

Connecticut has made the LLC formation process straightforward through its online business portal, making it easy to file documents, pay fees, access forms, and maintain compliance. Although the state has certain annual requirements, most filings are simple and affordable. This guide walks you through every step of forming your LLC in Connecticut so you understand exactly what to file, how much it costs, and what ongoing responsibilities you will have after formation. With this clarity, you can confidently launch your Connecticut business.

Steps to Start an LLC in Connecticut
------------------------------------

### Step 1. Choose a Name for Your Connecticut LLC

Your LLC name must be unique and distinguishable from other registered businesses in the state. You can check name availability using the Connecticut Secretary of State’s business registry search. If you want to hold your name while finalizing paperwork, you can file an Application for Reservation of Name for $60. The reservation holds your chosen name for 120 days. Your name must include a proper LLC designator such as “LLC,” “L.L.C.,” or “Limited Liability Company.” Avoid using restricted words such as bank, insurance, trust, or university unless you have the proper licensing or state approval. Names that resemble government agencies are prohibited.

### Step 2. Appoint a Registered Agent

Connecticut requires every LLC to appoint a Registered Agent. This person or business entity receives legal notices, state correspondence, and service of process on behalf of the LLC. The agent must maintain a physical street address in Connecticut and be available during normal business hours. You can appoint yourself, another trusted individual, or a commercial registered agent service. Your LLC cannot serve as its own agent. Choosing a dependable agent helps ensure your business does not miss important communications.

### Step 3. File the Certificate of Organization

The Certificate of Organization is the official formation document that legally creates your LLC. You must file this form with the Connecticut Secretary of State either online or by mail. The filing fee is $120. Information required includes your LLC name, address, Registered Agent details, and management structure. Online filings are typically approved quickly, often within a few business days. Once approved, the state will issue a confirmation that your business is officially recognized as a Connecticut LLC.

### Step 4. Draft an Operating Agreement

Although Connecticut does not require an Operating Agreement, creating one is strongly recommended. This document outlines ownership percentages, voting procedures, profit distributions, member responsibilities, and rules for adding or removing members. Without an Operating Agreement, your LLC will operate under Connecticut’s default laws, which may not match your preferred management style. A thorough Operating Agreement helps prevent misunderstandings and protects your LLC’s legal foundation.

### Step 5. Obtain an EIN

An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is issued by the IRS and functions as your business’s federal tax ID. You will need an EIN if you plan to hire employees, open a business bank account, or file certain federal taxes. Even single member LLCs benefit from having an EIN for banking and tax purposes. You can obtain an EIN for free through the IRS website. Most applicants receive their EIN immediately after completing the online application.

### Step 6. File the Annual Report

Connecticut requires all LLCs to file an Annual Report every year. The report is due by March 31. The filing fee is $80. This filing keeps the state updated on your Registered Agent, business address, and ownership details. Missing the deadline can result in late fees or loss of good standing. Filing the Annual Report online is simple and ensures your LLC remains compliant.

### Step 7. Register for State Taxes

Depending on your business activities, you may need to register for state taxes through the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services. LLCs selling taxable goods or services may need a Sales and Use Tax Permit. Employers must register for payroll taxes. Some industries require additional tax accounts or licensing. Connecticut does not charge a separate state franchise tax for LLCs. Still, you may owe state business taxes depending on your company’s revenue and operations.

### Step 8. Obtain Licenses and Local Permits

Connecticut does not issue a statewide general business license. However, most cities and towns require local permits or registrations. Depending on your business type, you may also need professional licenses regulated at the state level. Industries such as construction, health care, childcare, real estate, and financial services require specific certifications or approvals. Always check with your local government and state regulatory boards to ensure you have the proper licensing before operating.

How Much Does It Cost to Start an LLC in Connecticut?
-----------------------------------------------------

Connecticut’s fees are straightforward. Certificate of Organization. $120. Name Reservation (optional). $60. Annual Report. $80. Sales Tax Permit (if required). $100. Depending on your business location and industry, you may also have additional costs for local permits or professional licenses. Optional expenses include hiring a Registered Agent or seeking legal assistance to prepare your formation documents. These investments can help ensure accuracy and long term compliance.
