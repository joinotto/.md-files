Otto AI is modernising Finance

Your Finances, Under Control.
-----------------------------

Smart, simple finances for consultants — focus on your clients, deliverables, and insights, not tracking payments or sweating over tax season.

In Good Company

"Otto gets what creative businesses need—simplicity, speed, and no distractions."

Entity Management

Make Your Consultancy Official
------------------------------

Otto AI helps you form an LLC or S-Corp, separate your personal and business income, and present yourself as a legit business—not just a person who knows things.

Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping for Calendars, CRMs, Coffee, and Conferences
--------------------------------------------------------

Track every deductible—Zoom, Calendly, Notion, flights, laptops, coworking spaces, domain renewals, coaching platforms, and every productivity subscription you forget to cancel.

Invoicing

Invoices That Say ‘Yes, I Deserve This Rate’
--------------------------------------------

Send clear, branded invoices for retainers, audits, coaching packages, strategy calls, deliverables, and late-night miracle fixes. Otto AI makes getting paid less awkward and more automated.

Contracts

Contracts That Protect Your Time, Scope, and Sanity
---------------------------------------------------

Otto AI includes ready-to-use consulting agreements, NDAs, retainer contracts, scope-of-work clauses, and cancellation terms. Because “we’ll just figure it out” is not a business model.

Taxes

Tax Tools for the Consultant Who Does Everything Else on Time
-------------------------------------------------------------

Otto AI calculates your quarterly taxes, tracks income across clients and services, logs expenses automatically, and helps you avoid the annual “just file an extension” dance.

Reports

Know What Clients Are Worth the Effort
--------------------------------------

Otto AI breaks down your income by client, service, package, or timeframe—so you can focus on what pays best and phase out what drains your calendar.
