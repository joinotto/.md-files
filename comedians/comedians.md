Otto AI is modernising Finance

Your Finances, Under Control.
-----------------------------

Smart, simple finances for comedians — focus on your sets, your gigs, and your material, not receipts, invoices, or getting ghosted by a guy named Chad who said he’d Venmo you “tomorrow.”

In Good Company

"Otto gets what creative businesses need—simplicity, speed, and no distractions."

Founder · Sorry Dad Co.

Entity Management

From Open Mic to LLC
--------------------

Otto AI helps you set up an LLC or S-Corp so your career has legal protection, tax perks, and an actual business behind all those show flyers you made in Canva.

Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping for Flights, Gear, Drinks, and Therapy (Probably)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Otto AI tracks everything from mics and ring lights to Ubers, hotels, snacks, open bar receipts, and “costumes” that are just weird jackets. Snap a pic or connect your account—it’s all handled.

Invoicing

Get Paid for Every Gig, Roast, or Awkward Corporate Set
-------------------------------------------------------

Send professional invoices to comedy clubs, agencies, event organizers, brands, podcasts, and anyone who said “just send me your info.” Otto AI makes sure you actually get paid for being funny.

Contracts

Contracts So You Don’t Have to Trust That One Promoter Again
------------------------------------------------------------

Otto AI includes templates for show bookings, brand collabs, writing gigs, tour agreements, and licensing—because “handshake deals” don’t protect your punchlines.

Taxes

Tax Tools for People Who File on April 14th at 11:59 PM
-------------------------------------------------------

Otto AI tracks income from gigs, platforms, digital products, and tips. It calculates your quarterly taxes, organizes deductions, and keeps you from texting your ex-accountant in a panic.

Reports

Know What’s Paying (and What’s Just Practice)
---------------------------------------------

Otto AI shows you which gigs, platforms, and projects are earning—and which ones are just good for “stage time.” Make data-driven decisions, not just desperation tours.
