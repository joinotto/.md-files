What is S Corporation?
----------------------

An S Corporation (S Corp) is a special type of corporation created through an IRS tax election. It allows a business to enjoy the benefits of incorporation like limited liability protection, while being taxed similarly to a sole proprietorship or partnership. Unlike a regular C Corporation, which pays corporate income taxes, an S Corp allows profits and losses to pass through directly to the shareholders’ personal tax returns. This means the business itself doesn’t pay federal income tax, helping you avoid double taxation. But there’s more to it than just taxes. S Corps offer a formal structure that boosts your company’s credibility, while still giving you flexibility in how you pay yourself through a reasonable salary and additional tax-advantaged distributions.
