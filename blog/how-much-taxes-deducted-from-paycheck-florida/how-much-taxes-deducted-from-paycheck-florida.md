In this guide, we’ll break down how much taxes are deducted from a paycheck in Florida (FL), explain what factors affect your take-home pay, and show you how to estimate your paycheck using a [Florida paycheck calculator](https://joinotto.com/calculator/paycheck/florida).

By the end, you’ll not only understand what’s being taken out of your paycheck, but you’ll also know how to plan your finances more effectively.

Why Florida Is Different: No State Income Tax
---------------------------------------------

Let’s start with the good news: Florida does not have a state income tax. That means when you compare your paycheck to someone in California, New York, or Illinois, you’ll likely notice you keep more of your earnings.

*   Florida income tax rate: 0%
*   State payroll deductions: None for state income tax

However, federal taxes still apply to everyone in the U.S., regardless of where you live. That’s why you’ll still see deductions on your paycheck.

What Taxes Are Deducted from a Paycheck in Florida?
---------------------------------------------------

Even without state income tax, your Florida paycheck isn’t tax-free. Here’s what you’ll typically see:

### 1. Federal Income Tax

The biggest deduction for most workers.

*   Based on your income level and filing status (single, married, etc.).
*   Calculated according to IRS tax brackets.
*   Influenced by the information you provide on your W-4 form.

### 2. Social Security Tax

*   Rate: 6.2% of your gross wages.
*   Only applies to income up to the annual wage base limit ($168,600 in 2024).
*   Your employer matches this amount, so a total of 12.4% goes into Social Security.

### 3. Medicare Tax

*   Rate: 1.45% of your wages.
*   No income cap (applies to all earnings).
*   If you earn more than $200,000, an additional 0.9% Medicare surtax applies.

### 4. Other Possible Deductions

Depending on your employer and situation, you might also see:

*   Health insurance premiums
*   Retirement contributions (401k, IRA)
*   Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) or Health Savings Accounts (HSA)
*   Wage garnishments (if applicable)

Bottom line: Your Florida paycheck deductions mostly come from federal taxes and personal benefit contributions, not state taxes.

Federal Tax Brackets and Their Impact

*   12%: $11,601 – $47,150

If you earn $60,000 in Florida, you’ll fall in the 22% bracket. But remember: the U.S. uses a progressive tax system, so you only pay that rate on the portion above $47,150, not your entire income.
