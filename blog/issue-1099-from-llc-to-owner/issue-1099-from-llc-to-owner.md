The question of whether you can issue a 1099 to yourself from your LLC is a common one among business owners and freelancers. Many entrepreneurs who complete company registration and incorporation set up LLCs for tax benefits and liability protection, but when it comes to paying themselves, they often wonder if they need to issue a 1099 form.

In this comprehensive guide, we’ll break down the details, rules, and best practices surrounding issuing a 1099 to yourself from your LLC. We’ll also address frequently asked questions to help you navigate this topic with clarity.

**What Is a 1099 Form?**
------------------------

Before we dive into whether you can issue a [1099](https://joinotto.com/tax-forms/1099) to yourself, let’s first understand what a 1099 form is.

*   IRS Form 1099-NEC (Nonemployee Compensation) is used to report payments made to independent contractors.
*   If a business pays an individual or another business (excluding corporations) more than $600 in a year for services, they must file a 1099-NEC.
*   This form helps the IRS track self-employment income for tax purposes.

**What Does It Mean to 1099 Yourself from Your LLC?**
-----------------------------------------------------

When people ask, "Can I 1099 myself from my LLC?" they usually mean:

*   Can they issue themselves a 1099-NEC for work performed under their LLC?
*   Should they report payments from their own business as contractor income?
*   Is this an acceptable practice from a tax perspective?

The answer depends on the type of LLC you have and how it is taxed.

**How to 1099 Yourself: Understanding LLC Structures**
------------------------------------------------------

### **1. Single-Member LLCs and 1099s**

If you operate as a single-member LLC (SMLLC):

*   The IRS disregards your LLC for tax purposes, meaning your business income is reported directly on your Schedule C (Form 1040).
*   Since the IRS considers a single-member LLC the same as the owner for tax purposes, you cannot issue yourself a 1099-NEC.
*   Does a single-member LLC get a 1099? Generally, no—your clients or customers may issue your LLC a 1099, but you don’t issue one to yourself.

### **2. Multi-Member LLCs and 1099s**

If you operate a **multi-member LLC**:

*   The LLC is treated as a separate entity for tax purposes.
*   Members typically receive a K-1 form, not a 1099, to report their share of the income.
*   If you also provide services to your LLC as an independent contractor, you may be issued a 1099, but this depends on how the LLC is structured.

### **3. LLCs Taxed as an S Corporation**

If you’ve elected S Corporation (S Corp) taxation for your LLC:

*   You are required to pay yourself a reasonable salary as an employee.
*   Any additional income may be taken as distributions.
*   Since you are considered an employee, your LLC issues you a W-2, not a 1099.

### **4. LLCs Taxed as a C Corporation**

If your LLC is taxed as a **C Corporation (C Corp)**:

*   The corporation treats you as an employee.
*   You must pay yourself a salary through payroll and issue a W-2.
*   Can I 1099 myself from my C Corp? No, because you’re an employee, not a contractor.

**How to Make a 1099 for Yourself: When Is It Appropriate?**
------------------------------------------------------------

While issuing a 1099 to yourself is generally not allowed, there are some cases where you might be able to:

*   If you own multiple businesses and one business pays another for services, the paying business may issue a 1099 to the other.
*   If you’re an independent contractor under a separate entity (e.g., you personally own an LLC and also run another business).

**How Do I 1099 Myself? Step-by-Step Process**
----------------------------------------------

If you legally qualify to issue a 1099 to yourself (e.g., through separate entities), follow these steps:

1.   Confirm eligibility – Ensure your business structures permit this.
2.   Collect necessary information – Your EIN or SSN, business name, and payment records.
3.   Use IRS Form 1099-NEC – Report all payments over $600.
