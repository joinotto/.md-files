Imagine this: Your business is growing, customers are happy, but your [cash flow](https://joinotto.com/cash-flow) is stuck. Why? Because you're still waiting 30, 60, even 90 days for clients to pay their invoices. If this sounds familiar, you're not alone—and you're not out of options.

Enter invoice factoring—a financial solution that gives you access to the cash you've already earned. In this article, we’ll walk you through what invoice factoring is, how it works, who it’s for, its pros and cons, and how to decide if it’s right for your business. Let’s unlock your cash flow and take control of your income stream—without waiting around.

What Is Invoice Factoring?
--------------------------

Invoice factoring is a type of business financing that allows companies to sell their unpaid invoices to a factoring company in exchange for immediate cash. Instead of waiting for clients to pay, you get most of the invoice value up front—usually 70–90%.

The factoring company then takes on the task of collecting payment from your customers. Once your client pays, the factoring company sends you the remaining balance, minus their fee.

Think of it as turning your accounts receivable into working capital.

How Invoice Factoring Works (Step-by-Step)
------------------------------------------

**Step 1: You Complete the Work and Issue an Invoice**

You provide your product or service and invoice your client, typically with 30–90 day [payment terms](https://joinotto.com/invoicing/payment-terms).

‍

**Step 2: You Sell the Invoice to a Factoring Company**

You submit that invoice to a factoring company. They review the customer’s creditworthiness—not just yours.

‍

**Step 3: You Receive an Advance**

The factoring company pays you an advance—often around 85% of the invoice value.

‍

**Step 4: The Factoring Company Collects Payment**

Your client pays the factoring company directly, on the original due date.

‍

**Step 5: You Get the Balance Minus Fees**

Once the client pays, you receive the remaining 15%, minus the factoring fee (often 1%–5%).

‍

**1. Recourse Factoring**

You’re responsible if your client doesn’t pay. It’s riskier for you but comes with lower fees.

‍

**2. Non-Recourse Factoring**

The factoring company takes on the risk of non-payment. It’s safer but more expensive.

‍

**3. Spot Factoring**

You choose specific invoices to factor, one at a time. Great for occasional needs.

‍

**4. Contract Factoring**

You factor all (or most) invoices over a longer term. Better rates but less flexibility.

Who Should Use Invoice Factoring?
---------------------------------

Invoice factoring is best for:

*   B2B companies with net-30+ payment terms
*   Manufacturers, wholesalers, or service providers
*   Businesses with good-paying clients but slow payment cycles
*   Companies in growth mode that need fast capital

It may not be ideal if:

*   Your clients are high-risk or inconsistent payers
*   You have thin margins and can’t absorb factoring fees
*   You want to maintain full control of customer relationships

‍

**_Real-Life Example: How It Works for a Logistics Company_**

Let’s say Erica owns a small freight business. Her clients pay 45 days after delivery, but she needs money now to pay drivers and fuel costs.

‍

She sells a $50,000 invoice to a factoring company:

Receives an 85% advance: $42,500

Once the client pays, she gets the remaining 15%: $7,500

The factoring fee is 3%: $1,500

Net Cash Received: $49,000

Erica gets her money within 24 hours, keeps her business running, and avoids taking on debt.

Pros and Cons of Invoice Factoring
----------------------------------

**Pros**

*   Fast access to cash
*   Improves cash flow without new debt
*   No impact on equity or ownership
*   Flexible approval based on your customers' creditworthiness
*   Can grow with your sales volume

**Cons**

*   It costs money (fees can add up)
*   Not ideal for poor-credit or unreliable clients
*   Clients will know you're factoring (potential perception issues)
*   Can affect your brand relationship with customers

Invoice Factoring vs. Invoice Financing
---------------------------------------

People often confuse these two, but they’re different:

*   Invoice Factoring: The factor takes ownership of the invoice and collects from the client.
*   Invoice Financing: You retain control and repay the loan after receiving client payment.

If you want to keep client contact private, financing might be a better fit. But for speed and simplicity, factoring wins.
