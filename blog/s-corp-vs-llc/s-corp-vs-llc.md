Understanding LLCs
------------------

### What Exactly Is an LLC?

An LLC, or Limited Liability Company, is one of the most flexible and popular business structures for small businesses, freelancers, and startups. Think of it as a hybrid between a partnership and a corporation.

Key Features:

*   Limited Liability: your personal assets are safe. Provided your business is sued or otherwise owes money, it is business assets only which may be put in jeopardy.
*   Fluid ownership: You can be the member by yourself (single-member LLC), or you can admit a number of members (multiple-member LLC). Members may be individuals or corporate or even other LLCs.
*   Pass-through taxation: It defaults to a pass-through of profits to the individual personal [tax returns](https://joinotto.com/tax-return), not corporate tax is necessary.
*   Less paper, fewer rules: No annual board meetings or record-keepings of the kind.

**Example:**

Jasmine has a successful wedding planning outlet. Through an LLC, she protects her home and personal savings in a case of any business legal mess. Also she will have fairly simple tax returns- profits simply pass through to her as income.

### Common Misconceptions about LLCs

*   Myth: “LLC” is a tax status.

_Reality:_ It’s a legal business entity. Taxation can be as a sole proprietorship, partnership, C corp, or S corp.
*   Myth: All LLCs are taxed the same way.

_Reality:_ They can choose their tax classification.

Understanding S Corporations (S Corps)
--------------------------------------

### What Is an S Corp, Really?

S Corporation is not quite a kind of company. Rather, it is a special taxation status established under small businesses, which is taken through a filing with the IRS. First, however, you should become an eligible corporation or an LLC in order to elect S Corp status.

Key Features:

*   Pass-through taxation only: No corporate income tax. Business profits or losses are passed to shareholders’ personal tax returns.
*   Ownership restrictions: 

    *   Up to 100 shareholders
    *   All must be US citizens or residents
    *   Only individuals, certain trusts and estates allowed as shareholders

*   Corporate structure required: Must have a Board of Directors, officers, annual meetings, meeting minutes, etc.
*   One class of stock: All shares must have equal rights to distributions and voting.

**Example:**

Mark desires to establish a micro advertising company in the attraction of investors. He selects S Corp due to its credibility, capacity to issue a stock (to motivate early employees), and an opportunity to reduce self-employment taxes.

### Why S Corps Exist

Congress designed S Corps in the 1950s to nurture small firms into becoming corporations (which have the advantage of protection of assets) and these businesses were spared the burden of paying taxes not once but twice (at the corporate and shareholders level).

S Corp vs LLC Taxes: What Really Matters
----------------------------------------

### Default Tax Treatment

#### LLCs

*   _Single-member LLCs_: Taxed as sole proprietorships
*   _Multi-member LLCs_: Taxed as partnerships
*   _Can opt in_ to S corporation or C corporation taxation

Tax implications:

*   All profits are subject to self-employment taxes (Social Security and Medicare, 15.3%).

#### S Corps

*   Always taxed as pass-through entities—no corporate tax.
*   Owners/shareholders who work for the company are treated as employees. They must be paid a “reasonable salary”—payroll taxes apply to this portion, but distributions (other profits) are not subject to self-employment taxes.

S Corp vs LLC Taxes: Example
----------------------------

Suppose Lauren owns her own graphic design firm.

*   LLC taxation:

She earns $100,000 in net profit. She pays 15.3% self-employment tax on the full amount = $15,300, plus income tax at her bracket.
*   S Corp election:

She pays herself a “reasonable salary” of $60,000 (which incurs payroll taxes). The remaining $40,000 profit is taken as distributions, which aren't hit with self-employment tax. She saves on Medicare and Social Security taxes for that $40,000.

Key takeaway:

_If your business profits exceed a reasonable salary, S Corp status may lead to significant tax savings._

_Actionable tip:

If your LLC is making enough profit to pay yourself a fair market salary plus take extra profits, talk to your tax advisor about S Corp election—especially if you want to reduce your self-employment tax._

Can an LLC Own an S Corp?
-------------------------

You might hear about "LLC S Corp" or wonder if one can own the other.

### Short Answer

An LLC generally cannot own an S Corp. S Corporations have strict IRS rules:

*   Only U.S. individuals, certain trusts or estates can be shareholders
*   No corporations, partnerships, or (most) LLCs allowed as shareholders

### Exception:

A _single-member LLC_, treated as a “disregarded entity” for tax purposes, can own shares in an S Corp if its sole member is eligible. However, if the LLC is a partnership or taxed as a corporation, it cannot.

### Why This Matters

The rules are designed to prevent S Corps from being used as tax shelters by ineligible entities and to preserve the “small business” spirit of the S Corp model.

How to Choose: LLC or S Corp?
-----------------------------

### When to Choose an LLC

*   You are demanding the greatest flexibility: In ownership, management and taxes
*   Less current formality: No board meeting, shareholder minutes and complicated books
*   Foreign ownership/unlimited members: Desirable partnership/investment in foreign countries

*   Side hustle or solo business: This is especially true when you cannot make enough money to cover the S Corp salary minimums

### When to Choose an S Corp

*   You desire to save in self-employment taxes: Choose to get a part of your self-employment income as a salary and the rest in portions:
*   Stock to bring investors on board: Do you want to sell shares?
*   Future expansion: Establish yourself as a corporation in order to be credible/ to grow in future
*   You don t mind additional paperwork: It is comfortable to keep records, meetings and minutes

### How to Elect S Corp Tax Status as an LLC

1.   Form an LLC
2.   File IRS Form 2553 ("Election by a Small Business Corporation")
3.   Follow all IRS rules: ≤100 shareholders, U.S. individuals, only one class of stock
