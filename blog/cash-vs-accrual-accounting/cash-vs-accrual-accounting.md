‍

You’ll learn what each method means, how they work, their advantages and disadvantages, and how to decide which one is right for your business.

‍

What Is Cash Basis Accounting?
------------------------------

‍

[Cash basis accounting](https://joinotto.com/accounting/modified-cash-basis) records income when cash is received and expenses when they’re paid. It’s straightforward: money in, money out.

For example:

*   If you send an invoice in January but get paid in February, you record the income in February.
*   If you buy supplies in March but pay for them in April, you record the expense in April.

‍

### Pros of Cash Basis Accounting

*   Simplicity: Easy to understand and maintain.
*   Cash visibility: You always know exactly how much money is in your bank account.
*   Tax advantage: Income is only reported when received, which may delay taxes.

‍

### Cons of Cash Basis Accounting

*   Incomplete financial picture: Doesn’t account for money owed (receivables) or debts (payables).
*   Not GAAP compliant: Larger companies and those seeking outside investment usually can’t use it.
*   May mislead growth potential: Profitability can appear distorted.

‍

What Is Accrual Accounting?
---------------------------

‍

Accrual accounting records income when it’s earned (even if not paid yet) and expenses when they’re incurred (even if not yet paid).

For example:

*   If you invoice a client in January, you record it as income in January, even if they pay in March.
*   If you receive supplies in April but pay in May, you record the expense in April.

‍

### Pros of Accrual Accounting

*   Complete financial picture: Tracks receivables, payables, and long-term obligations.
*   Accurate profitability: Shows revenue and expenses in the period they happen.
*   Required for compliance: Public companies and many growing businesses must use accrual accounting.

‍

### Cons of Accrual Accounting

*   More complex: Requires more bookkeeping knowledge.
*   Cash flow blind spots: You can show profit on paper but still have no cash in hand.
*   Can be costly: May require [accounting software](https://joinotto.com/accounting) or a professional accountant.

Cash vs Accrual Accounting Examples
-----------------------------------

‍

**Example 1: A Freelance Designer (Cash Basis)**

Maria, a freelance designer, invoices a client $2,000 in December but gets paid in January. With cash accounting, she records the $2,000 as January income.

‍

**Example 2: A Growing Agency (Accrual Basis)**

Her agency grows and hires staff. By December, it invoices $10,000 and expects payment in January. With accrual accounting, it records the $10,000 in December, matching it against expenses that month to show true profitability.

‍

Which Method Is Best for Small Businesses?
------------------------------------------

‍

The right choice depends on your business size, goals, and industry:

‍

*   Cash accounting is best if:
    *   You’re a sole proprietor, freelancer, or very small business.
    *   You want simplicity and a clear view of cash flow.
    *   You don’t need to meet GAAP compliance.

*   Accrual accounting is best if:
    *   You plan to scale, seek investors, or get loans.
    *   You sell on credit or manage large inventories.
    *   You want a long-term, accurate view of profitability.

How to Switch From Cash to Accrual

‍
-------------------------------------

If you’ve been using cash basis but want to switch to accrual, here are the steps:

1.   Check IRS rules – For U.S. businesses, the IRS requires some businesses (like those with inventory) to use accrual.
2.   Adjust opening balances – Record accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory.
3.   Update your accounting software – Many platforms let you switch reporting methods.
4.   Consult an accountant – Switching impacts taxes, so get professional help.
