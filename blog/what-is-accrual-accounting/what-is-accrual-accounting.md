Have you ever wondered why your books don’t always match the money sitting in your bank account? That’s because there’s more than one way to record income and expenses. Most small businesses start with cash basis accounting, you log money when it actually moves. But as you grow, investors, lenders, and tax authorities often expect something more accurate: the accrual basis of accounting.

‍

What Is Accrual Accounting?
---------------------------

At its core, [accrual accounting](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/accrual-accounting) records revenue when it’s earned and expenses when they’re incurred, not when cash changes hands.

*   If you send an invoice in March but the client pays in April, the income belongs in March.
*   If you get billed in January for supplies you’ll pay in February, the expense belongs in January.

This approach matches income and expenses to the time period when they actually happen, giving you a truer financial picture.

In simple terms:

*   Cash basis = money in/money out.
*   Accrual basis = money earned/money owed.

Accrual Basis of Accounting: Key Features
-----------------------------------------

To really understand what is accrual accounting, let’s outline its main characteristics:

*   Revenue recognition principle: Record revenue when it’s earned, not when it’s received.
*   Matching principle: Match expenses to the period when they help generate revenue.
*   Use of accounts receivable and payable: Keeps track of money you’re owed and money you owe.
*   More complex but more accurate: It requires more bookkeeping, but the result is reliable [financial reporting](https://joinotto.com/reporting).

This is why accrual accounting is considered GAAP-compliant (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and is required for publicly traded companies.

‍

Accrual Accounting Example (Easy to Understand)
-----------------------------------------------

‍

Let’s break it down with a small business scenario:

Imagine you run a web design business.

*   On March 1, you complete a project worth $5,000 and send the invoice.
*   The client pays you on April 10.

How do you record this?

*   Cash basis accounting: Revenue shows in April.
*   Accrual basis accounting: Revenue shows in March (when the work was done).

Now, for expenses:

*   You hire a freelancer in January for $2,000, but you pay them in February.
*   Cash basis accounting: Expense shows in February.
*   Accrual basis accounting: Expense shows in January (when the work was performed).

See the difference? Accrual accounting aligns income and expenses with when they occur, not just when cash changes hands.

‍

Why Accrual Accounting Matters
------------------------------

So, what does accrued mean in accounting and why does it matter? It means recognizing money you’ve earned or owe before it’s physically exchanged.

This matters because:

*   It avoids misleading results (you don’t want one month to look super profitable just because all your invoices got paid at once).
*   It helps with forecasting (you know what’s coming in and what’s due).
*   It’s often required by investors, lenders, and regulators.

In short: if you want a clear and credible view of your business’s finances, accrual accounting delivers it.

Drawbacks of Accrual Accounting
-------------------------------

‍

It’s not perfect. Here are the downsides:

*   Timing Mismatches: You may show profit while your bank account is empty.
*   Admin Burden: More records, reconciliations, and adjustments.
*   Costs More: Often requires [accounting software](https://joinotto.com/accounting) or professional help.

‍

When Should You Use Accrual Accounting?
---------------------------------------

‍

*   You want to attract investors or apply for loans.
*   You carry inventory.
*   You’re scaling fast and need reliable reporting.

For freelancers or side hustlers, cash basis might still make sense. But if you’re serious about growth, accrual accounting is a smart step forward.

‍

How to Do Accrual Accounting (Step by Step)
-------------------------------------------

‍

1.   Set Up Accounts Receivable & Payable
    *   Track who owes you and what you owe.

2.   Record Revenue When Earned
    *   Create entries at invoice time, not payment time.

3.   Match Expenses
    *   Record expenses when incurred (like utility bills).

4.   Adjust Entries
    *   Add adjusting entries at period-end (depreciation, accrued wages).

5.   Use Software or AI Tools
    *   Platforms like Otto AI can automate accrual tracking and reporting.

Accrual Basis Accounting with AI
--------------------------------

‍

This is where Otto AI shines. Instead of manually juggling entries, AI can:

*   Auto-categorize transactions as accrual or cash.
*   Generate adjusting entries at month-end.
*   Predict accounts receivable collections with smart forecasting.
*   Flag unusual entries for review.

Compared to traditional accounting software, AI reduces errors and saves hours of bookkeeping time.

‍

Real-Life Accrual Accounting Example
------------------------------------

‍

Let’s take a small marketing agency:

*   January: Completed $20,000 of work, invoiced clients, but only $8,000 paid.
*   February: Paid $5,000 in contractor fees for January work.

On cash basis, January looks weak, and February looks bad.

 On accrual basis, January shows $20,000 revenue with $5,000 expenses → $15,000 profit.

That’s the true story of the business, why accrual accounting is trusted.
