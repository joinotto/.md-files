**Introduction to 1099s and LLCs**
----------------------------------

### **What Is a 1099?**

A [1099 form](https://joinotto.com/tax-forms/1099) is used by businesses to report payments made to independent contractors and freelancers. It’s part of the IRS’s effort to track income and ensure taxes are paid on all earnings. As a 1099 contractor, you’re considered self-employed and must handle your taxes, including self-employment taxes.

### **What Is an LLC?**

A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a business structure that combines the liability protection of a corporation with the tax benefits of a sole proprietorship or partnership. LLC owners are referred to as "members," and this structure can be tailored to suit single owners (single-member LLC) or multiple members.

### **Key Differences Between a 1099 and an LLC**

*   **Taxation**: A 1099 contractor pays taxes as a self-employed individual, while an LLC can offer flexibility in how income is taxed.
*   **Liability**: An LLC provides personal liability protection, unlike a 1099 contractor.
*   **Business Structure**: A 1099 is not a business entity but a tax classification, whereas an LLC is a formal business entity.
