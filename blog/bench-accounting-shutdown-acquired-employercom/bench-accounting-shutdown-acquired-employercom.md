**Who is Bench?**
-----------------

‍

Founded in 2012 as 10Sheet Inc., Bench Accounting quickly became a leader in bookkeeping services for small businesses across North America. By combining automation technology with human bookkeeping expertise, Bench allowed clients to focus on their core business activities rather than financial administration.

At its peak, Bench served over 12,000 clients, including freelancers, creative professionals, and small business owners. The company raised more than $113 million in venture capital, reflecting its rapid growth and innovative approach.

Bench became especially popular among creative entrepreneurs—graphic designers, photographers, writers, and content creators—who appreciated the convenience of automated bookkeeping paired with human oversight.

‍

**Why Did Bench Close?**
------------------------

‍

Several factors contributed to this sudden closure:

‍

The abrupt closure of Bench Accounting on December 27, 2024, left many clients in a difficult position, especially as tax season approached. The company announced that its platform was no longer accessible, causing significant disruption for their clients - including creative entrepreneurs and small businesses relying on their services.

‍

**Several factors contributed to this sudden closure:**

*   **Financial Challenges**: Despite raising over $113 million in venture capital, Bench struggled to maintain operations and adapt to the changing needs of its clients.
*   **Leadership Changes**: Internal disagreements and a shift in company direction led to instability, which may have impacted decision-making and overall performance. [Ian Crosby, the former CEO and co-founder, later reflected on X](https://x.com/ianwcrosby/status/1872724765221503188) that his ousting in 2021 may have contributed to the company’s loss of vision.
*   **Timing of the Announcement**: The closure was announced just before year-end, exacerbating the urgency for clients to find alternative bookkeeping solutions.

‍

In a notice of service closure, Bench acknowledged the abrupt nature of the decision and expressed their commitment to helping clients navigate the transition. According to the [press release from Employer.com](https://x.com/ianwcrosby/status/1872724765221503188), they are working diligently to ensure a seamless transition for Bench customers, allowing them to continue working with the same expert in-house bookkeepers they know and trust.

**Common Financial Mistakes Creative Professionals Make**
---------------------------------------------------------

‍

The Bench shutdown also serves as a cautionary tale. Many creative professionals make mistakes that can put their business at risk:

‍

### **1. Undervaluing Your Work**

Charging too little can stunt growth. Avoid this by:

*   Researching industry rates
*   Accounting for overhead, time, and non-billable work
*   Communicating the value of your work to clients

**Tip:** Even if you’re new, set a fair starting rate and increase it as your experience grows.

#### 2. Mixing Personal & Business Finances

Blurring the line between personal and business accounts can create chaos. Avoid this by:

*   Opening a separate business bank account and credit card
*   Using [accounting software](https://joinotto.com/accounting) to track business transactions
*   Paying yourself a regular "salary" from business funds

#### 3. Neglecting Taxes

As a self-employed professional, failing to save for taxes is a common trap. Avoid this by:

*   Setting aside 25–30% of income for taxes
*   Making quarterly estimated payments
*   Using tools like Otto AI to track deductible expenses

#### 4. Relying on One Client or Income Source

Diversification is critical:

*   Work with multiple clients
*   Explore passive income like digital products, courses, or printables
*   Secure retainer agreements for consistent income

#### 5. Not Building a Financial Safety Net

Creative work is often unpredictable. Build a 3–6 month emergency fund and consider income protection insurance for long-term security.

‍

#### 6. Ignoring Retirement Planning

Many creatives overlook retirement planning:

*   Start small and contribute regularly to SEP IRA or Solo [401(k)](https://joinotto.com/calculator/401k-calculator) accounts
*   Take advantage of compound interest
*   Consult a financial advisor familiar with self-employment

#### 7. Ineffective Budgeting

Without a clear budget, money can quickly slip away. Avoid this by:

*   Using budgeting tools to monitor income and expenses
*   Allocating funds for business development, marketing, and personal needs

#### 8. Failing to Track Expenses

Regular tracking ensures tax efficiency and business awareness:

*   Use apps to capture receipts and categorize expenses
*   Review monthly to identify areas for cost reduction

#### 9. Working Without Contracts

Contracts protect your time and income:

*   Clearly define scope, payment terms, and deadlines
*   Use AI contract generators or legal templates to save time

#### 10. Neglecting Professional Development

Continuing education keeps you competitive:

*   Attend workshops, webinars, and conferences
*   Stay updated with tools, trends, and client expectations

#### 11. Poor Cash Flow Management

Inconsistent cash flow can jeopardize operations:

*   Invoice promptly and follow up
*   Require deposits for large projects
*   Use forecasting tools to anticipate lean periods

#### 12. Avoiding Financial Education

Even basic financial literacy matters:

*   Read books or take courses on business finance
*   Understand bookkeeping, taxes, and cash flow
*   Consult financial advisors to optimize financial strategy
