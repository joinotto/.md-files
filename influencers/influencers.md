Otto AI is modernising Finance

Your Finances, Under Control.
-----------------------------

Smart, simple finances for influencers — focus on content, not contracts, taxes, or chasing that one brand who still owes you.

In Good Company

"Otto gets what creative businesses need—simplicity, speed, and no distractions."

Entity Management

Turn Your Influence Into an Actual Business
-------------------------------------------

Otto AI helps you register an LLC or S-Corp—because running a six-figure brand from your living room should still come with legal protection, tax savings, and grown-up credibility.

Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping for Ring Lights, Editors, and Brand Trips
-----------------------------------------------------

Otto AI tracks your income and expenses from gear, paid tools, travel, editing software, assistants, promo materials, and that one avocado toast you wrote off as “client meeting.” Everything’s auto-categorized, audit-ready.

Invoicing

Invoicing for Brands, Agencies, and Collabs That Pay Late
---------------------------------------------------------

Send branded, itemized invoices for sponsored posts, reels, stories, integrations, UGC, affiliate sales, and paid shoutouts. Otto AI helps you bill professionally and get paid faster.

Contracts

Contracts That Keep You Covered and Credited
--------------------------------------------

Use Otto AI’s influencer-focused contract templates to protect your rates, deliverables, deadlines, content usage rights, and licensing terms. Never accept “we’ll send a brief later” as a legal agreement again.

Taxes

Tax Help That Works With Your 12 Income Streams
-----------------------------------------------

Otto AI tracks every payment from brands, platforms, affiliate links, merch, consulting gigs, and your digital product side hustle. It estimates your taxes, reminds you of quarterly deadlines, and helps you avoid influencer tax drama.

Know Which Deals Made You Bank (and Which Were a Flop)
------------------------------------------------------

Otto AI gives you clear reports showing what clients, platforms, and services actually pay off. Start making content decisions based on data—not vibes.
