**Understanding Clergy Taxes**
------------------------------

Unlike traditional employees, clergy members are often classified as dual-status taxpayers—considered employees for income tax purposes but self-employed for Social Security and Medicare taxes. This distinction impacts how earnings, housing allowances, and deductions are reported and taxed.

### **Key Tax Considerations for Clergy**

*   **Housing Allowance Exemption**

Ministers may be eligible for a tax-free housing allowance, reducing taxable income. However, the allowance must be designated in advance by the church and used for qualified housing expenses.
*   **Self-Employment Tax (SECA vs. FICA)**

Clergy members typically pay Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) tax, covering Social Security and Medicare. Unlike regular employees, ministers must pay the full 15.3% self-employment tax unless they opt out under specific conditions.
*   **Tax Deductions for Ministers**

Clergy can deduct work-related expenses, including travel, books, continuing education, and professional dues. Proper record-keeping is crucial to maximize tax savings.
*   **Exemption from Self-Employment Tax**

Some clergy members may qualify for an exemption from SECA taxes if they have religious objections to receiving Social Security benefits. This requires filing IRS Form 4361 and meeting strict criteria.
*   **Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments**

Since churches typically do not withhold taxes from clergy earnings, ministers must make quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid penalties and interest.
