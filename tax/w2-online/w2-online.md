### Steps to Get a Copy of Your W-2 Online

Follow these steps to obtain a digital copy of your W-2:

2.   **Check Payroll Services:** If your employer uses a third-party payroll provider (e.g., ADP, Paychex), visit the provider’s website. Register or log in to access your W-2.
3.   **Use IRS Online Tools:** If your employer cannot provide your W-2, the IRS offers tools to retrieve your tax records. Use the "Get Transcript Online" service to access a wage and income transcript, which includes information from your W-2.

### How to Use the IRS "Get Transcript Online" Tool

The IRS provides a secure online tool to access your tax records, including W-2 data. Here’s how to use it:

1.   Visit the [IRS Get Transcript Online](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript) page.
