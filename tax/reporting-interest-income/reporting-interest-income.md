Interest Income: What You Need to Know
--------------------------------------

Interest income is a common source of earnings for individuals and businesses. It includes any interest earned on savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), loans you’ve made to others, or bonds. The IRS considers most forms of interest income taxable, and understanding how to report it correctly is essential for compliance with tax laws.

### What is Interest Income?

Interest income refers to the earnings you receive from lending money or from financial investments. It is typically reported to you and the IRS on Form 1099-INT, "Interest Income," or Form 1099-OID, "Original Issue Discount," depending on the type of interest earned. This income is generally taxable unless specifically exempted.

### Types of Interest Income

*   **Savings Account Interest:** Interest earned on funds held in a savings account at a bank or credit union.
*   **Bond Interest:** Earnings from investments in corporate, municipal, or U.S. government bonds.
*   **Certificates of Deposit (CDs):** Interest accrued on CDs held with financial institutions.
*   **Loan Interest:** Interest received from personal or business loans made to others.
*   **Tax-Exempt Interest:** Certain bonds, such as municipal bonds, may generate interest income that is exempt from federal income tax.

### How is Interest Income Taxed?

Interest income is generally taxed as ordinary income. It is added to your total taxable income for the year and is subject to your marginal tax rate. However, some forms of interest income, such as tax-exempt interest, are not included in your taxable income but may still need to be reported to the IRS.

### How to Report Interest Income

1.   **Receive Form 1099-INT or 1099-OID:** Financial institutions and other entities that pay you $10 or more in interest income are required to issue a Form 1099-INT or Form 1099-OID.
2.   **Use Form 1040:** Report taxable interest income on your Form 1040, Schedule B, "Interest and Ordinary Dividends," if your total taxable interest exceeds $1,500.
3.   **Separate Tax-Exempt Interest:** Report tax-exempt interest income on Form 1040, but it is not included in your taxable income.

### Special Considerations

*   **Tax-Exempt Interest:** Interest earned from municipal bonds is exempt from federal income tax but may still be subject to state taxes.
*   **Foreign Interest Income:** If you earn interest income from foreign sources, it must be reported and may be subject to special rules.
*   **Penalties for Non-Reporting:** Failure to report interest income can result in penalties, interest on unpaid taxes, and audits.

### Tips for Managing Interest Income

*   Keep accurate records of all interest-earning accounts and investments.
*   Review your Form 1099-INT and Form 1099-OID for accuracy and report discrepancies to the issuer.
*   Consult a tax professional for advice on complex interest income situations or investments.
