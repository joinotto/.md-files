Deductible expenses reduce your taxable income and can be claimed on your [tax return](https://joinotto.com/tax-return) to lower your overall [tax liability](https://joinotto.com/tax/tax-liability). Both individuals and businesses can benefit from understanding which expenses are deductible.

### **Deductible Expenses for Individuals**

Whether you're a salaried employee, freelancer, or retiree, you may be able to claim various deductions. Here are some of the most common:

*   **Mortgage Interest**

If you own a home, you can typically deduct interest paid on your mortgage, especially for your primary residence and in some cases a second home. This deduction is capped based on the amount of the loan.
*   **Student Loan Interest**

You can deduct up to $2,500 of interest paid on qualifying student loans. This applies even if you don't itemize your deductions.
*   **Medical and Dental Expenses**

Qualified unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted [gross income](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping/gross-income) (AGI) are deductible. This includes procedures, prescriptions, and health insurance premiums (in some cases).
*   **Charitable Contributions**

Donations made to qualified nonprofits—cash, goods, or mileage driven for charitable work—can be deducted. Be sure to keep acknowledgment letters or receipts.
*   **State and Local Taxes (SALT)**

You can deduct up to $10,000 in state and local income, sales, and property taxes combined.
*   **Retirement Contributions**

Contributions to traditional IRAs and other qualified retirement accounts may be deductible, depending on your income and participation in employer-sponsored plans.
*   **Educator Expenses**

Teachers and eligible educators can deduct up to $300 of out-of-pocket classroom supplies per year.

**Business Deductible Expenses**:
---------------------------------

*   **Business Meals**: A portion of meals directly related to business activities can be deducted.
*   **Travel Costs**: Business-related [travel expenses](https://joinotto.com/tax/deductible-travel-expenses), including airfare and lodging, are deductible.
*   **Home Office**: If you work from home, you may be able to deduct a portion of your housing expenses as a [home office deduction](https://joinotto.com/photographers/home-office-deduction).

### **Important Notes and Best Practices**

*   **Keep Thorough Records**

Save receipts, invoices, bank statements, mileage logs, and written explanations for all deductions. Digital tools like expense-tracking apps can simplify this process.
*   **Use Accounting Software**

Consider using [AI bookkeeping software](https://joinotto.com/bookkeeping) or apps tailored to freelancers and small businesses to automatically categorize deductible expenses.
*   **Understand IRS Requirements**

The IRS has strict guidelines about what qualifies as “ordinary and necessary” for business deductions. If you’re unsure, consult a tax professional.
*   **Stay Updated**

Tax laws change frequently. Deductions that were allowed last year might be adjusted or removed in the current year’s tax code.

### **Pro Tip: Consider Itemizing vs. Standard Deduction**

For individuals, it may be more beneficial to itemize your deductions if they exceed the standard deduction (which is $13,850 for single filers and $27,700 for married couples filing jointly in 2024). Evaluate both methods to determine which provides the greater benefit.
