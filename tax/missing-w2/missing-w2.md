Never Received W2
=================

What Does It Mean to Never Receive a W-2?
-----------------------------------------

Not receiving a **W-2** form can be confusing, especially if you worked during the year and expected to get this important tax document. A W-2 is a form that employers send to employees to report wages earned and taxes withheld. If you never receive your W-2, it may lead to issues when it's time to file your taxes.

### Why Might You Not Receive a W-2?

There are several reasons you might not get your W-2:

*   **Wrong Address:** Your employer might have sent it to the wrong address if they didn't have your current information.
*   **Independent Contractor:** If you were an independent contractor instead of an employee, you would receive a **1099 form** instead of a W-2.
*   **Employer Oversight:** Sometimes, employers simply forget to send out W-2 forms, which can cause delays.

### What Should You Do If You Don't Get Your W-2?

If you haven't received your W-2 by mid-February, take these steps:

1.   **Contact Your Employer:** Reach out to the HR department or payroll to ask about your W-2.
2.   **Check Your Online Account:** Some companies provide W-2 forms online, so log in to see if it’s available there.
3.   **Document Your Income:** If all else fails, keep records of your earnings and taxes withheld, so you can file your taxes accurately.

### What Happens If You Still Don't Get It?

If you still can’t get your W-2 after following the steps above, you can:

*   **File Form 4852:** This is a substitute for a W-2 that you can file with your taxes if you don't receive the original.
*   **Notify the IRS:** If there are issues, contacting the IRS can help guide you on what to do next.

Remember, it’s important to have this form to accurately report your income and taxes for the year.
