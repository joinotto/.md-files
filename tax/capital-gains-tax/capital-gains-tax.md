Capital Gains Tax
=================

Capital gains tax is the tax on the profit from the sale of an asset, such as stocks, real estate, or collectibles. The rate at which you're taxed depends on how long you held the asset.

**Types of Capital Gains**:
---------------------------

*   **Short-Term Capital Gains**: Gains on assets held for one year or less, taxed at your ordinary income tax rates.
*   **Long-Term Capital Gains**: Gains on assets held for more than one year, taxed at reduced rates (0%, 15%, or 20% based on income levels).

**Strategies to Minimize Capital Gains Tax**:
---------------------------------------------

*   **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains by selling other assets at a loss.
*   **Holding Period**: Holding investments for longer than one year can reduce tax liability by qualifying for long-term capital gains rates.**‍**
*   **1031 Exchange**: A strategy to defer taxes on capital gains from the sale of real estate by reinvesting in similar properties.
