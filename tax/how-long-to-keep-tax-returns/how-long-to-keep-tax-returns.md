How Many Years Of Tax Returns Should You Keep
=============================================

How Many Years of Tax Returns Should You Keep?
----------------------------------------------

Keeping your tax returns is important for a few reasons. First, it helps you if the IRS decides to audit you. An audit is when they check your financial records to make sure everything is correct. So, how long should you keep your tax returns? Generally, it's recommended to keep your tax returns for at least **three years**. This is the typical period the IRS has to audit your returns. However, there are some situations where you might need to keep them longer.

### Why Keep Tax Returns for Longer Periods?

In some cases, you should hold onto your tax returns for more than three years:

*   **Six Years**: If you underreport your income by more than 25%, the IRS can go back six years to assess additional taxes.
*   **Indefinitely**: If you never file a return or if you file a fraudulent return, it’s best to keep records indefinitely. This way, you're prepared if any issues arise.

### How to Organize Your Tax Returns

To stay organized, you can:

*   **Create a Folder**: Use a physical folder or a digital one on your computer to store all your tax documents.
*   **Label Everything**: Clearly label each year’s returns and any supporting documents you have, like W-2 forms or receipts.
*   **Regularly Review**: Set a reminder to review your documents each year and dispose of those that are no longer needed.

By keeping your tax returns organized and stored for the right amount of time, you help protect yourself from any future tax issues that may arise.

In cases of fraud or failure to file, there is no statute of limitations, which means you should keep your records indefinitely.
