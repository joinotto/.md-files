W-9 FAQs
--------

### What is a W-9 form and who needs to fill it out?



A W-9 form is an IRS document used to collect a payee’s name, address, and TIN so a payer can issue a 1099. Independent contractors and freelancers fill out a W-9 form before receiving $600+ in payments. By providing a completed W-9, you enable the payer to generate accurate 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC forms at year-end.

### How do I fill out a W-9 form online?



To fill out a W-9 form online, open the fillable W-9 PDF in your browser and type in your legal name, tax classification, address, and TIN. Use an online fillable W-9 form to complete each box accurately, then sign electronically (if supported) or print to sign by hand. Finally, save and download the W-9 PDF for free before sending it to your requester.

### Is the W-9 form fillable and printable for free?



Yes. The IRS provides a fillable W-9 form PDF at no cost, and Otto AI offers a free W-9 generator to download a fillable W-9 template. Simply open the PDF, enter your details in the fillable fields, and print or save the completed form. This means you get a free W-9 form online without any fees or sign-up requirements.

### When should I provide a W-9 form to a client or employer?



You should provide a completed W-9 form to any client or company hiring you as an independent contractor before they pay you $600 or more during the tax year. By submitting your W-9 early, the payer can issue accurate 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC forms at year-end. If your information changes (e.g., new address or TIN), fill out a new W-9 form to keep their records updated.

### How do I correct an error on a W-9 form I’ve already submitted?



If you need to fix a mistake on your W-9, open a fresh fillable W-9 form, enter the correct name, address, or TIN, and check the “Corrected” box at the top. Download the new W-9 PDF and send it to the requester so they can update their records before issuing your 1099. Using a free fillable W-9 form ensures the corrected version meets IRS formatting requirements.
