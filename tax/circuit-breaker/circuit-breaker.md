What is a Circuit Breaker?
--------------------------

A **circuit breaker** is a safety device used in finance and investments to temporarily halt trading on an exchange during significant price declines. This mechanism is designed to prevent panic selling and give investors time to evaluate the situation. Imagine it as a pause button that helps maintain order in the financial markets when there’s too much chaos. Circuit breakers are important for protecting investors from extreme market volatility.

### Why Are Circuit Breakers Important?

Circuit breakers play a crucial role in ensuring market stability. Here are some key points:

*   **Prevent Panic Selling:** When stock prices plummet rapidly, investors may react emotionally and sell off their assets in fear. Circuit breakers provide a moment to reflect and make rational decisions.
*   **Market Integrity:** By pausing trading, circuit breakers help maintain a fair market where prices can adjust to new information rather than be driven down by panic.
*   **Investor Protection:** These mechanisms protect investors from making hasty decisions that could lead to significant losses during turbulent times.

### How Do Circuit Breakers Work?

Circuit breakers are triggered when the market index falls by a specific percentage within a trading day. Here’s how it typically works:

1.   **Threshold Levels:** Different exchanges set threshold levels (e.g., a 7%, 13%, or 20% drop) that trigger the break.
2.   **Time Limits:** Once triggered, trading may be halted for a set period, like 15 minutes, allowing traders to reassess.
3.   **Systematic Resumption:** After the pause, trading resumes, but the market is more level-headed, helping to avoid wild price swings.

### What Happens After a Circuit Breaker Is Triggered?

After a circuit breaker is activated, several things can happen:

*   **Market Reassessment:** Investors take a moment to evaluate their positions and the market situation before resuming trading.
*   **Price Stabilization:** Once trading resumes, there’s often a more stable market environment as investors have had time to think things over.
*   **Continued Monitoring:** Exchanges continue to monitor market conditions closely to determine if further intervention is necessary.

In summary, circuit breakers are essential tools in financial markets that help maintain stability during extreme fluctuations, giving investors a chance to make informed decisions rather than acting on impulse.
