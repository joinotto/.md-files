What is a 1095 Form?
--------------------

A **1095 form** is an important document related to health insurance in the United States. It is used to report information about health coverage provided to individuals under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). There are three different types of 1095 forms: 1095-A, 1095-B, and 1095-C. Each serves a different purpose and is used by different organizations.

*   **Name of the Insured:** This is the person who had the health coverage.
*   **Coverage Period:** The dates when the insurance coverage was active.
*   **Coverage Type:** Information about the type of health insurance plan you had.
*   **Dependents:** Names of any dependents covered under the same insurance.

This information is crucial for filing your taxes as it shows whether you had health coverage for the year and helps determine if you owe any penalties for not having insurance.
