Household Employee: Understanding Tax Responsibilities
------------------------------------------------------

A household employee is someone you hire to perform services in or around your home, such as a nanny, housekeeper, gardener, or personal care aide. If you hire a household employee, you may have tax obligations, including paying Social Security and Medicare taxes, as well as unemployment taxes. Understanding your responsibilities can help you stay compliant with IRS rules and avoid penalties.

### Who is Considered a Household Employee?

According to the IRS, a worker is classified as a household employee if you control what work is done and how it is done. Common examples of household employees include:

*   Nannies and babysitters.
*   Housekeepers and maids.
*   Gardeners and landscapers.
*   Personal care aides or home health workers.

Independent contractors, such as plumbers or electricians, are not considered household employees since they control how the work is performed.

### Tax Obligations for Household Employers

If you hire a household employee, you may need to pay employment taxes, including:

*   **Social Security and Medicare Taxes (FICA):** You must pay these taxes if you pay your employee $2,600 or more in 2023.
*   **Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA):** You must pay FUTA if you paid $1,000 or more in wages during any calendar quarter in the current or prior year.
*   **State Taxes:** Some states also require unemployment or other payroll taxes for household employees.

### Steps to Comply with Tax Requirements

To fulfill your tax responsibilities as a household employer, follow these steps:

1.   **Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN):** Apply for an EIN through the IRS to report household employment taxes.
2.   **Verify Employment Eligibility:** Complete Form I-9, "Employment Eligibility Verification," for each employee.
3.   **Calculate and Withhold Taxes:** Withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from your employee’s wages and match these amounts yourself.
4.   **Pay Taxes:** Use Schedule H (Form 1040), "Household Employment Taxes," to report and pay employment taxes when you file your personal income tax return.

### Additional Considerations

There are specific rules and exemptions related to household employees:

*   **Exemption for Family Members:** You are not required to pay employment taxes for your spouse, children under 21, parents, or other family members who work for you.
*   **Workers Under 18:** Social Security and Medicare taxes are not required for household employees under 18 unless household employment is their principal occupation.
*   **Unemployment Taxes:** FUTA taxes do not apply to certain family members and employees under specific circumstances.

### Tips for Household Employers

*   Keep accurate records of wages paid and taxes withheld.
*   Provide your household employee with a Form W-2 at the end of the year.
*   File Schedule H with your annual tax return to report employment taxes.
*   Consult a tax professional or payroll service for assistance with compliance.

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

Failure to comply with household employment tax requirements can result in penalties, including fines and interest on unpaid taxes. Maintaining accurate records and timely filings can help you avoid these issues.
