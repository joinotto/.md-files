A $135,000 lump sum is a one-time payout, not split over time. It could be severance, a lawsuit settlement, or a big client payout. Unlike regular income, it’s a single drop of cash—perfect for creative pros with varied streams, but it needs a plan.

You get $135,000 all at once—via check, direct deposit, or otherwise. Examples:

Taxes or penalties might shrink it, so check the source before spending.

To figure out what you keep from $135,000, use this:

Example:

*   **Gross:** $135,000
*   **Federal Tax (22% supplemental):** $29,700
*   **State Tax (5%):** $6,750
*   **Net:** $135,000 - $29,700 - $6,750 = $98,550

Your exact net depends on the payment type and your situation.
