### What is a casualty loss and how does it affect my tax return?



A casualty loss is a type of financial loss that occurs due to a sudden, unexpected event that causes damage to your property. This could include natural disasters like hurricanes or floods, accidents, theft, or vandalism. To claim a casualty loss on your tax return, you must itemize your deductions, which means giving up the standard deduction in favor of detailing each deductible expense. When determining the amount of your casualty loss, you'll need to calculate the reduction in the property's value as a result of the incident. This is generally the lesser of the decrease in fair market value or the adjusted basis of the property. The IRS allows you to claim the loss only to the extent that it exceeds a certain threshold, which is typically a portion of your adjusted gross income. It's important to keep thorough records of the loss, including any documentation of the event, photos of the damage, and any related repair costs. If you are affected by a disaster declared by the federal government, you may have additional options for claiming the loss on your taxes, including the possibility of amending prior year returns to claim the loss in a different tax year. Always consult with a tax professional to navigate the specifics of your situation and ensure you comply with all regulations.
