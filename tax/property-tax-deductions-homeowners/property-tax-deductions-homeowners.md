Property Tax Deductions Homeowners
==================================

Are Property Taxes Deductible?
------------------------------

Property taxes paid on real estate may be deductible on your federal income tax return, providing significant savings for homeowners. However, there are limits and rules that determine how much you can deduct and what qualifies as deductible property tax.

### What Property Taxes Are Deductible?

Deductible property taxes must be:

*   Levied by state, local, or foreign governments.
*   Based on the assessed value of the property.
*   Charged uniformly across similar properties in the area.

### Limits on the Deduction

The total deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), including property taxes, is capped at $10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately).

### How to Claim the Deduction

To deduct property taxes:

*   Itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040).
*   Keep records of property tax bills and payments.

### Non-Deductible Payments

Non-deductible items include:

*   Assessments for local benefits like sidewalks or sewer systems.
*   Property taxes on rental properties (deductible on Schedule E instead).
